<p>Plasmids take two forms:
</p>

<ul>

<li>an open circular form;</li>

<li>a supercoiled knotted form (twisted like a skein of yarn) that
migrates faster in gels.</li>

</ul>

<p>For accurate comparison of fluorescence intensities in gels, the
contributions from both coiled and uncoiled plasmid markers should be
added and compared to the unknown band.
</p>

<h3>DNA Sequencing</h3>

<p>The most important technique is variously known as Sanger
sequencing, dideoxy sequencing, chain termination sequencing or
enzymatic sequencing.  To sequence, we need template DNA, DNA
polymerase, a sequencing primer, 4 dNTPS including labeled dATP, a
sequencing buffer and MgCl<sub>2</sub>.  After mixing, pipette
aliquots to four tubes each of which contains a different
dideoxynucleotide.  Use about 20:1 dNTP:ddNTP.  Dideoxyribonucleotides
terminate DNA synthesis because DNA polymerase cannot add another dNTP
if there is no hydroxyl group at the 3' end of the chain.  After each
G on the newly synthesized strand, a finite number of molecules,
perhaps 1/1000, will incorporate a ddGTP and terminate.  Elongated
molecules in the ddGTP tube will therefore have a specific
distribution of lengths: 25, 29, 36, 37, 42 . . .
</p>

<p>Run the solutions from the 4 tubes in separate lanes on a thin,
high-density polyacrylimide sequencing gel.  Polyacrylimide gels allow
separation of single base-pair MWs and there permit sequences to be
read off.   The shortest molecules may have no labeled dATPs and may
not show in the gel.   
</p>

<p>Sanger sequencing started in the 1970's and originally used
radioactive labeling.

<h3>Classical sequencing technique:</h3>

<ol>

<li>Clone the fragment to be sequenced into suitable vector (YAC, BAC,
P1);</li>

<li>Subclone into a subfragment (plasmid, M13 or cosmid);</li>

<li>Prepare templates;</li>

<li>Run sequencing reactions;</li>

<li>Perform gel electrophoresis;</li>

<li>Read sequence;</li>

<li>Run analysis.</li>

</ol>

<p>The last 4 steps are now completely automated.  The NEB/MBP course
was started 19 years ago when Steve and Bart developed a method to use
<sup>35</sup>S rather than <sup>32</sup>P for sequencing.
<sup>35</sup>S bands were thinner and could be 50 bases higher up a
gel.  They started a course to teach <sup>35</sup>S sequencing and
decided to include a segment on cloning.  The rest is history.
