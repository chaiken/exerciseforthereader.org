<p>Chromosomes have DNA in million-bp lengths but random shearing
during collection breaks it into segments of about 10<sup>5</sup>
length.  The mouse genome is about 3.3x10<sup>9</sup> bp long, which
is typical for mammals.  The distribution of the GAATTC Eco R1 site is
close to random.  The length of EcoR1-digested DNA fragments is about
3000 bp on average.  The digestion runs overnight due to the variety
of the sites to be cut.
</p>

<p>Zn fingers are a type of protein recognition site for some
particular DNA sequences.
</p>

<p>When germ cells are used as a source of DNA, only one copy of each
gene is obtained since germ cells are haploid.  The mouse DNA in
Expt. 1 came from somatic cells and so will contain two copies of each
chromosome for each cell.
</p>

<p>Due to its negative charge, DNA migrates from the negative to the
positive pole in an electric field.  This migration is the basis for
gel electrophoresis where DNA is separated on the basis of its
charge/length ("molecular weight") ratio.
</p>

<p>The lambda phage has 48,502 base pairs of DNA.  Lambda can be used
as a vector or as a molecular weight (MW) marker.
</p>

<p><b>Recombinant DNA</b>: DNA from two sources ligated together in
vitro.  Typically recombinant DNA includes a vector and "foreign DNA."
</p>

<p><b>Cloning vector</b>: a DNA molecule that enables your foreign DNA
to replicate in a host cell, usually E. coli.
</p>

<p><b>Genomic library</b>: a collection of clones representing all the
fragments of a given genome.
</p>

<p>Viruses can have four kinds of genetic material: double-stranded
(ds) DNA, single-stranded (ss) DNA, dsRNA, ssRNA.  All are observed in
nature.
</p>

<p>Mouse DNA simply inserted into E. coli would not replicate due to
lack of appropriate biochemical signals.  We will need to attach
foreign DNA to a molecule that has a "replication origin" binding site
for E. coli's DNA polymerase.  Human DNA does have a replication
origin that works in mouse cells.

<p>
The chromosome in E. coli contains the genes necessary for survival.
It is attached in many places to the cell membrane.  The plasmid
contains the restriction enzymes and antibiotic resistance genes.
E. coli cells have 100-200 plasmids.  The E. coli chromosome is about
4x10<sup>6</sup> bp in length.
</p>

<p align="center" height="495" width="317"><img src="ecolichromo.png">

<p>Increasingly the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is making other
tools in biology obsolete.  However cloning of the type we will do in
the lab is still necessary for genes whose sequence is not known.
</p>

<p>Bacteriophages are the vector of choice for making libraries due to
their efficiency (meaning large number of DNA copies per vector cell).
Plasmids are another common vector.  Phages have 1 linear piece of DNA
in their head.
</p>

<p>Each restriction enzyme will create a slightly different genomic
library.   Splitting of genes among different sites in the library
doesn't in the end cause a problem.
</p>

<p><b>Phage life cycle:</b>
<ol>

<li>Specific binding of phage tail protein to E. coli cell membrane
occurs.</li>

<li>Bacterial cell will degrade linear DNA unless it forms a circle.
DNA ligase performs the connection of the sticky "cos" ends of the
lambda chromosome.  Phage DNA circle has a replication origin for
E. coli.  100-200 copies of phage DNA are made per cell.
</li>

<li>Lambda phage gene are expressed and phage proteins are made.
</li>

<li>Progeny phage assemble spontaneously.
</li>

<li>E. coli cell lyses, releasing phage.
</li>

</ol>

This whole cycle takes about 45 minutes.
<p>

</p>

Note that cloning works only because DNA from all living creatures
(virus, plant, animal, bacteria) has the same structure.
<p>

The advantage of plasmids as vectors is that they can replicate larger
DNA sequences than bacteriophages.
<p>

<h3>Steps for Constructing a Genomic Library</h3><p>

<ol>

<li>Isolate and purify DNA.   The cellular origin doesn't matter
(except that blood, immune and gamete cells are different).
</li>

<li>Cleave large fragments with restriction enzymes (AKA restriction
endonucleases).
</li>

<li>Select a cloning vector.   Lambda phage is the vector of choice
for genomic libraries.
</li>

<li>Cleave cloning vector with the same restriction enzyme as used for
foreign DNA.  The overhanging base-pair ends on the foreign and vector
now match.</li>

<li>Bind foreign and vector DNA using DNA ligase.   Now we have
recombinant molecules.
</li>

<li>Package your recombinant DNA into phages.  This is the genomic
library.</li>

<li>Infect the phages into E. coli.</li>

<li>"Plate out" infected cells on a Petri dish.</li>

<li>Determine the titer of the library = plaques/&#181;L of library.
</li>

<li>Replate at 50 plaques per plate (the most usable density).</li>

<li>Screen the library to find genes of interest.</li>
<p>

</ol>

<p>EcoR1 actually only cuts GAATTC when the G is near the 5' end of the
DNA molecule.  This directionality is called "dyad symmetry."  Not all
enzymes have this feature.  The cut is made where G and A are
connected in the backbone.  All restrictions enzymes cut the
phosphodiester bond leaving new 5' and 3' ends.   For EcoR1, the
remaining 8 hydrogen bonds of the 4x(A-T) sequence is not enough to
hold the two long strands together.   Restriction enzymes are
catalytic -- they go off to cut other strands.
