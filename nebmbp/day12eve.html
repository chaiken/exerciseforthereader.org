<h3>On beyond the Human Genome Project</h3> 

<p>The LINE1 repeat is a "molecular parasite" that reproduces itself.
Only 2% of DNA encodes proteins.   RNA splicing eliminates intron
loops to turn pre-mRNA into mRNA.   "Alternative splicing" can give
rise to different mRNAs.   Commonly alternative splicing hooks
different modular domains together in different configurations.
</p>

<p>In humans a gene is about 1300 nt on average with 9 exons.  2/3 of
genes have "splice variants," a higher fraction than in other
organisms.  Humans and other mammals have more protein diversity from
the same domains than simpler organisms.  40% of human genes have an
unknown function.  A large fraction of all identified genes are the
housekeeping ones.  The genes unique to humans primarily are for
immunology, neural development, blood clotting, transcription factors
and regulatory proteins.   The human proteome has perhaps
10<sup>5</sup> proteins.
</p>

<p>In humans the Y chromosome mutation rate is twice that of X.  The
human founder population is small, perhaps about 1000 individuals.
Humans have about 1.2x10<sup>6</sup> single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs).  The worldwide SNP consortium studies them.   SNPs have many us
uses, among them:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Identification of disease susceptibility;</li>

<li>Prevention of adverse drug reactions;</li>

<li>Understand multigenic diseases (asthma, heart disease);</li>

<li>Parental screening.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Future goals of major molecular biology projects</h3>

<ul>

<li>Transcriptomics: large-scale RNA studies;</li>

<li>Proteomics: protein expression and function;</li>

<li>Structural genomics: 3D structures of proteins;</li>

<li>Knockout studies: gene inactivation;</li>

<li>Comparative genomics to understand evolution.</li>

</ul>

<h3>$1000 individual genome sequencing: how?</h3>

<p>Since people are different at only the 1 ppt level, any sequencing
technology must be very accurate.  Right now the cost per person is
about $1.5x10<sup>6</sup>.  Possible methods include:
</p>

<ul>

<li>NanoPCR: the same method as now but miniaturized;</li>

<p>The players in nanoPCR are Amersham/Pharmacia/GE with it
384-capillary sequencers; 454 Corporation, a spin-off of Curagen,
which has picoliter plates with thousands of wells/plate; and Visigen
which makes novel polymerases and dyes.
</p>

<li>Sequencing chip technology based on array hybridization;</li>

<p>The players are Selexa Total Genotyping, Perlegen and Affymetrix.
</p>

<li>Single-molecule detection technologies</li>

<p>Research efforts are ongoing at US Genomics and Genovoxx.  Optical
mapping is also under consideration.
</p>

<li>Nanopore technologies;</li>

<p>Major efforts are underway at UCSC (where 50 bases can be read at
one time) and Lynx MPSS (massively parallel signature sequencing).
The leading candidate is Polony, a Harvard spin-off which is using
"microPCR colonies."
</p>

<li>Novel labeling chemistries for DNA.</li>

</ul>
