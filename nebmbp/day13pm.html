<h3>RNA interference (RNAi)</h3>

<p>The expression of a given gene can be down-regulated by eliminating
its cognate mRNA.   An RNA should be blocked by insertion of its
antisense strand into the cell as dsRNAs are degraded.   RNA
interference is similar to gene knockout but is much cheaper.   It's a
fast, inexpensive way to do "gene silencing."   RNA interference uses
a "phenocopy" of a mutation.   
</p>

<p>There are many methods of performing RNA interference.  For
example, feed C. elegans nematode worms some E. coli that are
expressing the interfering RNA.  Alternatively microinject the
interfering RNA, induce absorption via electroporation, or simply put
the worms in a solution containing the RNA.
</p>

<p>Surprisingly a recent paper (A. Fine, <strong>Nature</strong> 391
(1998)) showed that dsRNAs have a stronger interfering effect than
antisense RNAs.  dsRNAs are most effective because they copy
themselves and move from cell to cell like a retrovirus.  RNA
interference has also been shown to work in Drosophila, mammals and
plants.
</p>

<p>Organisms use naturally occurring "microRNAs" as
post-transcriptional method of regulating gene expression.  Methods of
destroying RNAs are important since otherwise transcripts can hang
around for days in eukaryotes.  "Short interfering" SI-RNAs are 20-25
nt in length and work best in mammals.  Longer interfering sequences
are called RNAis.  Small RNA fragments found in gels were always
thought to be degraded RNAs but they can also be microRNAs!
</p>

<p>Postulated in vivo roles for RNAis:
</p>

<ul>

<li>block retroviruses;</li>

<li>transposon (like LINE1) suppression;</li>

<li>gene regulation via microRNAs.</li>

</ul>

<p>Exogenous (artificially inserted) dsRNA binds to dicer RNAse III.
Dicer cuts it into SI-RNAs of 21 nt length in mammals.  21 nt
fragments bind into RISCs (RNA interfering short complexes).  RISCs
cuts mRNAs and gene expression is turned off.  All of this occurs in
the cytoplasm.  dsRNA works as a silencer because it binds the RISC
complex.  Antisense RNA only works by binding to mRNA directly.  It's
unknown if retroviruses have any method to block dicer.
</p>

<p>To turn off a particular gene using dsRNA, clone the appropriate
cDNA into a plasmid.  Use the T3 and T7 promoters to make two ssRNAs
in pBluescript and then mix them together.
