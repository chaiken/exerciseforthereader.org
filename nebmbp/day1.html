Recommended text: <strong>Genes</strong> by Benjamin Lewin.
Recommended laboratory manual: <strong>Current Protocols in Molecular
Biology</strong> by F.M. Ausubel et al. (the "Red Book").
</p>

<p>This session is the 51st of the New England Biolabs Summer School,
which is in its 19th year.  There are about 2500 graduates.
</p>

<p>Expt. 1: The reverse transcriptase (RevT) family makes up 17% of
the human genome and is the largest gene family.  Two new papers about
the role of RevT appeared in <i>Nature</i> during the first week of
June.  The high copy number of RevT makes experiments with it easier.
The technique used for lower-copy genes is the same.
</p>

<p>
The bacteriophage lambda infects E. coli.  We will clone our RevT gene
into lambda and then subclone into a plasmid.
</p>

<p>Expts. 2 and 3: We will study the Ttr (transthyretin) gene, which
was previously called both Tth and prealbumin.  The name prealbumin
comes from running just above the common protein albumin on a gel.
</p>

<p>Expt. 4: A cDNA (copy DNA) library contains about 1% of the the DNA
that a genomic library would have since it comes only from expressed
genes.  The direct source of a cDNA library is mRNA (messenger RNA).
</p>

<p>Expt. 5: We will all measure our own "DNA fingerprints."  The
chances of two individuals having identical DNA fingerprints is 1 in
82x10<sup>9</sup>.
</p>

<p>To begin Expt. 1, we will cut mouse genomic DNA (DNA from a
chromosome, not from mRNA) with the restriction enzyme EcoR1.  EcoR1
cuts only the sequence GAATTC between the G and the first A.  While
not 100% efficient ("No biological reaction runs to 100% completion"),
EcoR1 should in principle cut the DNA everywhere this sequence occurs.
The starting DNA in Expt. 1 is typically 1x10<sup>5</sup> base-pairs
(bp) long and after cutting will be more like 3000 bp in length.
These smaller pieces are more suitable for genomic library analysis.
