<h3>Screening a cDNA library</h3>

<p>Last night we unidirectionally ligated our cDNA into Lambda Zap II
using EcoR1 on one side and Xho1 on the other.  The left arm of Lambda
Zap II has a lac operon promoter that will allow proper transcription.
(A eukaryotic promoter would mean nothing to E. coli.)  Excision of
the pBluescript plasmid from Lambda Zap II is performed using a helper
phage included in a kit from Stratagene.
</p>

<p>7x coverage for a cDNA library should give all mRNAs in a given
tissue.  The cDNA library can then be screened by hybridization or
PCR.  For screening with a probe from another species, hybridization
is preferable as it can be less stringent.  Hybridization probes
themselves can be luminescent although a chemiluminescent reaction is
10x more sensitive.  A cDNA library (unlike a genomic library) can
also be screened with an antibody to the protein that the insert
expresses.  The lac promoter in the plasmid can be turned on with
lactose or IPTG to make sure that the gene is expressed.
</p>

<p>Adding a cDNA onto lac Zalpha is an example of "gene fusion."  The
product is an example of "protein fusion."
</p>

<p>cDNA clones offer differ in length because:
</p>

<ul>

<li>the 5' ends of mRNA can be partly degraded;
</li>

<li>RNA polymerase may not make it all the way to the end of the
gene.</li>

</ul>

<p>With luck, all that will vary between cDNA clones will be the
length of the untranslated regions at either end of the mRNA.  There
are protein sequencing machines that clip off one amino acid, run the
protein through a chromatography column, clip off another amino acid,
run through a column again, etc.  Proteins are about 300 amino acids
long on average with genes typically about 1000 bp long.
