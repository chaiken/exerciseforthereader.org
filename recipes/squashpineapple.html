    <h1>
    Spicy Squash, Pineapple and Onions
    </h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
    You won't be surprised to hear that this is a recipe that I made
    up.  It's spicy, high in fiber and low in fat.  The dish would be
    fine without the brown sugar, rendering it downright healthy.  The
    result looks very pretty and makes a fine winter comfort food.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ingredients
    </h2>
    <h3>For the seeds:
    </h3>
    <p>
    seeds from two squash<br/>
    1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) salt<br/>
    1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) shichimi pepper or cayenne<br/>
    1 tablespoon (15 mL) olive oil<br/>
    </p>
    <h3>
For the main dish:    
</h3>
    <p>
      2 medium winter squash such as butternut, kabocha or acorn<br />
      1 pineapple<br />
      3 onions<br />
      1 large hunk ginger, perhaps 3" (7.5 cm) long<br />
      1 habanero pepper<br />
      1/2 cup (120 mL) brown sugar<br />
      1/2 cup (120 mL) olive oil<br />
      1 teaspoon (5 mL) each mace and nutmeg<br />
      2 teaspoons (10 mL) salt
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>For the seeds</h3>
    <p>
    Preheat the oven to 350. Whack the stem off each squash and cut it
    in half longitudinally.  Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and
    spread them evenly on a cookie sheet.  Bake for about 30 minutes
    or until you hear the seeds popping.  Slide the seeds into a bowl,
    add the other ingredients and stir.  Eat.
    </p>
    <h3>For the main dish</h3>
    <p>
    Peel the squash carefully, as even long-duration baking will not
    make the skin edible.  Hack it into 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes.  Peel
    the pineapple and chop coarsely.  Chop the onions.  Peel the
    ginger and puree it into a blender with the habanero, oil and
    spices.  Mix the squash, pineapple, onions and spices together and
    place them in the oven.  Stir after 30 minutes and serve after one
    hour.
    </p>
    <h2>The easy way to peel pineapple</h2>
    <p>For years I employed the pineapple-peeling method recommended
    in the venerable <em>Joy of Cooking</em>.  The method is slow and
    tends to result in either wasted pineapple or bits of peel on the
    fruit chunks.  Juice leaks all over the cutting board as you
    wrestle with the slippery fruit.
    </p>
    <p>Here's a better way: chop the top and bottom off the pineapple.
    Slice off one piece about an inch (2.5 cm) thick and place the
    rest of the fruit in a bowl to collect the dripping juices.  Place
    the circular slice flat on the cutting board with the larger
    diameter side up.  Use a paring knife to cut around the edge of
    the slice between the skin and the fruit.  Throw the skin away and
    chop the slice, placing the pieces in the bowl.  Repeat until the
    whole fruit is chopped.
