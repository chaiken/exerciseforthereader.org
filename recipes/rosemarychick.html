      Pan-Roasted Chicken with Rosemary, Garlic and White Wine
    </h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      from <em>Essentials of Italian Cooking</em> by Marcella
      Hazan. As with many other Marcella Hazan recipes, this dish
      proves that delicious meals need not be complicated. Hazan's
      cookbooks are full of entertaining and helpful comments that
      may remind you of the Rombauers. For this reason they are
      highly suitable for beginning cooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 tablespoon (15 mL) butter<br />
      2 tablespoons (30 mL) vegetable oil<br />
      A 3 1/4 lb (1.4 kg) chicken, cut into 4 pieces [this is the
      only chicken recipe where I leave the skin on]<br />
      2 or 3 garlic cloves, peeled [6 or 7 is better, pureed in the
      blender]<br />
      1 sprig of fresh rosemary or 1/2 teaspoon dried leaves<br />
      salt<br />
      fresh-ground black pepper<br />
      1/2 cup (115 mL) dry white wine
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Put the butter and oil in a saute pan, turn on the heat
      to medium high, and when the butter foam begins to subside,
      put in the chicken quarters, skin side down. [I use all corn
      oil instead since I almost never cook with butter. Save the
      jiblets in the freezer to make soup stock at a later date.]
      </li>
      <li>Brown the chicken well on both sides, then add the garlic
      and rosemary. Cook the garlic until it becomes colored a pale
      gold, and add salt, pepper and the wine. [I add a couple of
      dried New Mexico chiles too.] Let the wine simmer briskly for
      about 30 seconds, then adjust heat to cook at a low simmer,
      and put a lid on the pan, setting it slightly ajar. Cook
      until the bird's thigh feels very tender when prodded with a
      fork, and the meat comes easily off the bone, calculating
      between 20 and 25 minutes per pound. If while the chicken is
      cooking, you find the liquid in the pan becomes insufficient,
      replenish it will 1 or 2 tablespoons water as needed. [Bah!
      Pour in more white wine.]
      </li>
      <li>When done, transfer the chicken to a warm serving
      platter, using a slotted spoon or spatula. Remove the garlic
      from the pan. [Why??] Tip the pan, spooning off all but a
      little of the fat. Turn the heat up to high and boil the
      water away while lossening cooking residues from the bottom
      and sides with a wooden spoon. Pour the pan juices over the
      chicken and serve at once. [Serve with brown rice, which
      absorbs the gravy better than white.]
      </li>
    </ol>
