This recipe assumes unhulled lentils, which I have never seen in an
American store.  The original recipe gives a very soupy result.  It's
fine to use any kind of lentils although the cooking times and needed
water vary quite a bit and you shouldn't mix two kinds unless you cook
them separately in the first step.

Red split lentils with cabbage
From Madhur Jaffrey's _Indian Cooking_, Barron's Press, ISBN 0-08120-2700-0

Serves 4-6

1 1/4 cups red split lentils, picked over, washed and drained

2 cups water (the original recipe says 5 cups)

1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric

5 tablespoons vegetable oil

1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds

2-4 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped

1 medium onion, peeled and cut into fine slices

1/2 lb cored and finely shredded green cabbage 

1-2 fresh hot green chilies, finely sliced

1 1/2 teaspoons salt

1 medium tomato, peeled and finely chopped

1/2 teaspoon peeled and finely grated fresh ginger


Put the lentils and the 2 (not 5) cups water into a heavy pot and
bring to a boil.   Add the turmeric and stir to mix.   Cover and
simmer gently for 10 minutes (original recipe says 75 minutes!).
Stir a few times.  

While the lentils cook, heat the oil in a big frying pan over a medium
flame.  When hot, put in the cumin seeds.  Let them sizzle for 3-4
seconds.  Now put in the garlic.  As soon as the garlic pieces begin
to brown, put in the onion, cabbage and green chilies.  Stir and fry
the cabbage mixture for about 10 minutes until it begins to brown and
turn slightly crisp.  Add 1/4 teaspoon salt to the mixture and stir it
in.  Turn off the heat.

When the lentils are almost done, add 1 1/4 teaspons of salt, the
tomato and the ginger.  Stir to mix.  Cover and cook another 10
minutes.  Add the cabbage mixture.  Stir to mix and bring to a simmer.
Simmer uncovered 2-3 minutes or until cabbage is heated through.
