      This recipe is a great way to get rid of skunked beer. It's
      also a great comfort food. I like this because I love root
      vegetables. No need to measure any of the ingredients. It's
      best to start this the night before you want to eat it. Makes
      the house smell great.

      Ingredients
    </h2>
    <p>
      1 large corned beef brisket<br />
      2 or 3 cans (0.7 to 1 kg) of cheap beer, e.g. MGD<br />
      a couple of dried chiles, perhaps serranos<br />
      1 or 2 teaspoons (5-10 mL) coriander seeds<br />
      1 or 2 teaspoons (5-10 mL) mustard seeds<br />
      a few dashes cinnamon<br />
      a few dashes of allspice<br />
      3 or 4 large potatoes, scrubbed and chopped in quarters<br />
      5 or 6 carrots, coarsely sliced<br />
      3 or 4 turnips, scrubbed and sliced<br />

      I have received several requests for the original Corned Beef
      and Beans recipe. I didn't save the original article because
      I was familiar with the recipe already. This is how I have
      been cooking my St. Patrick's Day corned beef for the past
      nine years. It is a little different from the recipe posted
      but it is close and I like it. Perhaps the original poster
      can be prevailed upon to post his or her recipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buy a corned beef brisket at your local supermarket. In a
      pot, pour 12 ounces (340 g) of beer. Add a bay leaf or two, a
      dried red chile or two, a teaspoon or two (5-10 mL) of
      coriander seeds, a teaspoon or two (5-10 mL) of mustard
      seeds, a few dashes of cinnamon, a few dashes of allspice,
      and all the juice from the corned beef pack. Put the corned
      beef on a steamer rack in the pot and add water to bring the
      liquid level up to the bottom of the rack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cover the pot and put it on some heat and bring the liquid to
      a boil. Steam for several hours (it took me five hours for a
      4 lb (2 kg) brisket) until the meat doesn't feel rubbery when
      you stick a fork in it. Add water or beer or both as needed
      to keep some liquid in the pot. [I usually steam the corned
      beef over night.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Remove the meat and slice. Remove the steamer rack. [I just
      leave the meat in at this point. It's in no condition to
      slice.] Leave all the other stuff in the pot and put in some
      potatoes and carrots and turnips or whatever. Add water [or
      beer!] to cover and boil until the stuff is cooked. Remove
      all the vegatables and potatoes. [I leave the potatoes,
      carrots and turnips in.] Put the steamer rack back in and put
      in some cabbage wedges. Steam them for about five to ten
      minutes, depending on how crisp or soggy you like cabbage. [I
      use 15 minutes.] Serve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now here is the part I was raving about. This is the first
      year I have tried this and is based on the brilliant
      recommendation of a poster whose name and email address I do
      not have or I would thank him or her personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Get out some beans which you have thoughtfully left soaking
      overnight in water (I used white beans, red beans and black
      beans all mixed up). Drain them and put them in a pot. Cover
      them with the liquid that you have been using to cook the
      corned beef and cabbage and potatoes and vegatables. The
      liquid should be about an inch higher than the beans. Simmer
      for three or four hours or until the beans are as firm or as
      mushy as you like them. The beans will not be ready with the
      rest of the meal but, as the original poster noted, you can
      eat them reheated the next day when the flavors have had a
      chance to "marry".
    </p>
    <p>
      Delicious. Good luck.
