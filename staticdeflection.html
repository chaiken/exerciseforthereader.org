<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>
These desired properties imply a cantilever chip mounted with a spring
clip inside a glass well with a removable cover.  Use of a well rather
than channels will minimize reagent use.  The well and an o-ring
groove will be formed by etching a glass wafer.  The flat cover will
be held down with a low-force spring clip to accomodate the thermal
expansion of the solution.  The assembly will be mounted inside a
copper block with an integrated temperature sensor and with a hotplate
or Peltier heater attached.  The fact that the heater surrounds the
glass wells will minimize convection.  Hole(s) will have to be drilled
for optical access.  The fluid cell will sit in a recess milled in the
copper block to facilitate alignment with the optical access hole.</p>

<p>The Berkeley design has two ports per well in order to allow air to
escape.  A cell made from two bonded wafers could have two ports for
each well within the o-ring.  Therefore the feature of pipetting into
one port while having the cantilever in the other could also be
preserved.  However caution is necessary so that fluids from the two
wells don't mix either during dispensing or heating.  This is
especially true if the illumination comes from the filling side, as
then the cells must be full.  The Berkeley Microfab Lab has a
wafer-bonder for glass.  The Berkeley stockroom has 4" borosilicate
($10) and quartz wafers ($40) in stock.
</p>

<p>
A sturdy clip that accomodates multiple cantilever designs is
desirable.  The clip doesn't have to make electrical contact or allow
for actuation of the cantilever.  It must be possible to mount a
cantilever, seal the fluidic chamber and then locate the laser beam
onto the cantilever tip.  Reflections from the glass may complicate
matters.  If a cantilever with a tip is used, the laser beam must be
incident on the tipless side.  Probably attaching the cantilever to
the lid and then the lid to the wafer with the cells is the easiest
method.
</p>

<p>One possibility for removing the thermal-expansion-induced
deflection of the cantilever is to put matching films on either side.
The side to be functionalized can have a Cr/Au coating, while the
other side can have a plain Cr coating.  Whatever the initial
deflection (unimportant if not too large), we expect no temperature
dependence if the thickness-TCE products of the two sides are equal.
While this balancing will indubitably not completely eliminate any
temperature-dependent background, it should substantially reduce it.
Coating one side of the cantilevers at a time with an evaporator
should not be difficult.
</p>

<h3>First pass at cell design</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="cell.jpg"></p>

<p>Here I've drawn the o-ring as rectangular, although clearly the
task of finding the right size would be made easier by using a round
o-ring.
</p>

<p>
The spring clamp is copied from Veeco's fluid cell.  A piece of wire
is formed into a torsion spring at its attachment point where it is
epoxied to the glass.  The wire's other end goes through a small hole
in the glass (sealed how?) and forms a clip that holds the chip.  The
pressure on the chip is determined by a coil spring around the wire
that is in compression.  Because the lid is the removable component,
the mounting of the cantilever can be done under a convenient separate
stereo zoom microscope.   
</p>

<p>It's not clear from this drawing how the laser beam would be
incident on the cantilever chip.  I'm assuming that the position and
tilt of the chip can be chosen so that the laser can be placed at a
reasonable distance and the reflection can be collected by a detector.
The large size of the spring clamp compared to the chip makes this
task more difficult.  A major question is whether there's a workable
design with one-sided optical access so that the lower side can be
clamped on a heater.  The question comes down to: will capillary waves
on the top surface or distortion in the cap ruin the image?  A system
which allows two-sided access would permit using the Berkeley chips
but would complicate the optics and thermal design.  Perhaps the
one-sided optical access could be from the bottom.  Another point is
that the laser should reach the cantilever by going through only
unmachined, unetched glass surfaces, not the tilted flat that is used
for mounting.
</p>

<h3>Choice of cantilevers:</h3>

<p>The size of the paddle at the end of the cantilever is constrained
by the requirement that the mark not walk off the end as it deflects.
At 0.2 microns/K (Berkeley number), over 80 C, the tip deflects 16
microns.  Assuming that thermally induced deflections are not
cancelled by proper coating, the paddle at the end of the cantilever
must be 50-100 microns in diameter.  The lens diameter is about 1 mm;
lens focal length is about 5 cm.  Final beam diameter = lambda * f/D =
33.5 microns.
</p>

<p>
According to <a href="min_2darray.pdf">Min's paper</a> the deflection
deltaH due to a stress sigma (in J/m<sup>2</sup> or N/m) is given by
Stoney's Formula:</p>

<p align="center">deltaH = (/ (* 3 sigma (- 1 nu) (* L L)) (* E d d))</p>

<p>
where nu is the Poisson ratio (0.3 for SiN), E is modulus
(1.8x10<sup>11</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup> for SiN) and L and d are length
and thickness.  The Si bulk modulus is 1.5x10<sup>11</sup>
N/m<sup>2</sup> and that its Poisson ratio is 0.17.  Thus (/ (- 1 nu)
E) for SiN is 3.9x10<sup>-12</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/N and for Si is
5.5x10<sup>-12</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/N, giving bulk Si a 40% advantage
for the same cantilever dimensions.  Si also has a higher reflectivity
in the red although this may not matter with a thick enough
metallization.  Sensitivity will scale with (L/d)<sup>2</sup>.  Let's
call ((1 - nu)/E)*(L/d)<sup>2</sup> the "compliance."  Here are the 
 <a href="cantilever_compare.el">calculations</a> for the table.

<p>
<em>Conclusion:</em> cantilevers with similar sensitivity to the
Berkeley ones are commercially available.  The best choice might the
NanoWorld Arrows, which combine reasonable sensitivity with
experimentally convenient width and are available tipless and in array
form.  (However, the specifications of the Arrows show that the
thickness may vary by up to a factor of 5!)  The Arrow TL-2
cantilevers cost $18 each in lots of 50.  Alternately similar tipless
bulk Si cantilevers could be made here at HPL -- they are much simpler
than the heated-tip, electrically contacted Porcupine cantilevers we
already have.

<h3>Further discussion of ? items</h3>

<menu>

<li>Would it be desirable to build the system around the new
   microscope, which isn't being used?  Then fluorescence could be
   observed while performing the deflection experiment.
</li>

<li>Would it worth the extra effort to have multiple cantilevers per
   cell to get parallel redundant measurements?  Having multiple
   cantilevers would give some signal averaging and reduce the chances
   of an outlier result due to a single bad device.
</li>

<li>Will differential measurements improve sensitivity or ease
interpretation?  Two separate wells could be located in the same glass
block, one a test and one a control cell.  For a differential
measurement to work well, the two wells must be at precisely the same
temperature; the two devices must be quite similar in properties; and
a sufficient equilibration time must be allowed after pipetting
different solutions into the two different wells.
</li>

<li>Either multiple cantilevers per cell or a differential measurement
might be most easily accomplished with the type of CCD setup that UCB
has.  For two or one devices, a four-quadrant detector (as used in
AFMs or the ARS laser writing system) should be adequate.
</li>

<li>
The old DI AFM has a 670 nm diode laser that looks through a tilted
dichroic mirror at the cantilever, which is tilted up at an angle.
The reflected light goes back through the mirror (which is transparent
to red) and is incident on the four-quadrant detector.  The video
camera illumination is mostly reflected from the dichroic
(interference-based) mirror.
</li>

</menu>

<h3>Potential Problems</h3>

<menu>

<li>Leakage of fluid at elevated temperatures.  Or cracking of glass
parts.
</li>

<li>Stress causes warping of cantilever resulting in unusable reflection.
</li>

<li>Capillary waves on the top surface of the fluid will cause noise
in the detector if the meniscus doesn't touch the cap.
</li>

<li>Problems with non-specific binding and fouling of the cell.
</li>

<li>Great difficulty in aligning the system (that is, getting the
laser spot onto the cantilever tip or the reflection onto the detector
after replacing the lid).
</li>

<li>Differential measurement fails due to fabrication differences
between cantilevers or temperature gradients.
</li>

<li>Cantilever moves around during temperature scan.
