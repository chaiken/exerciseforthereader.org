    <p>
      At the moment it is not possible to tell why the in-plane
      ordering of the films grown on
      Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(1120) is inferior to that grown
      on the (001) MgO and Ge substrates. The difficulty with the
      Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> growth may have to do with the
      6&deg; miscut of the substrates, or it may be due to an
      intrinsic difficulty with (011) growth of the Fe/Si
      multilayers. Previous work has shown that AF coupling in
      Fe/Si multilayers is dependent upon formation of a metastable
      iron silicide spacer layer phase.[4] The possibility exists
      that the spacer silicide does not grow well on Fe in the
      (011) orientation. This question can be answered only by
      further growth studies on better (011) substrates and careful
      structural characterizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      A related question is whether the larger remanent magnet
      moment in the (011)-textured films might be due to a
      fundamental difference in magnetic properties from the
      (001)-textured films. Because a 46-repeat Fe/Si multilayer
      grown on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has a remanence of only
      about 10%, this is unlikely. Undoubtedly the trilayer on
      Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has a higher remanence than the
      multilayer because the thinner film is more greatly impacted
      by the poor substrate surface quality. The staircase
      morphology caused by the 6&deg; miscut of this
      Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> substrate may lead to wavy
      interfaces between the Fe and iron silicide films or to
      pinholes through the silicide layers. Wavy interfaces can
      cause increased magnetostatic coupling or even biquadratic
      coupling,[11] both of which would tend to increase the
      remanence. The large remanence of the multilayers grown on
      glass substrates is likely also due to pinholes or
      magnetostatic coupling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pinhole-induced may explain the unusual temperature
      dependence of the remanence. (Magnetostatic coupling is
      expected to be approximately temperature-independent.) Fe
      atoms in bridges through the silicide spacer layers are
      expected have a reduced Curie temperature. A larger remanence
      at low temperature therefore makes sense if the remanence is
      derived from pinhole coupling and is not an intrinsic effect.
      Low Curie-temperature material may also be present in the
      iron silicide spacer layer or in at the iron/iron silicide
      interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      By growing on a number of substrate materials and by using
      different deposition conditions, Fe/Si multilayers have been
      prepared with a varying degree of ordering. A large amount of
      accumulated evidence demonstrates that high remanence of the
      magnetization curves in Fe/Si multilayers is associated with
      interface roughness. The remanence is therefore not likely to
      be related to unusual exchange coupling but instead to
      originate from defects, perhaps pinholes through the silicide
      spacer layer. Since the remanent magnetization is caused by
      extrinsic effects, future studies should concentrate instead
      on measurements of the saturation field of the magnetization
      curves in order to learn more about the interlayer coupling.

      Osgood III and Y. Huai for helpful discussions, and B.H.
      O'Dell and S. Torres for technical assistance. Part of this
      work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department
      of Energy by LLNL under contract No. W-7405-ENG-48.
