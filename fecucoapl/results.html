      <a href="fig1.html">Figure 1(a)</a> shows magnetization
      curves for two Fe-Cu-Co sandwiches grown during the same run,
      but deposited at different substrate temperatures of 220 and
      165 &deg;C. As the figure illustrates, sandwiches grown at
      temperatures 220 &deg;C and above reproducibly have square
      magnetization curves, indicating that the Fe and Co moments
      are reversing together. However, in the sandwiches deposited
      at 165 &deg;C and below, the Co and Fe do indeed have
      different coercivities, as demonstrated by the presence of
      the shoulder in the magnetization curve at H = 0.1 kOe. For
      the increasing field part of the loop, the shoulder
      corresponds to the field region where the moment of the Fe
      film has already reversed, but the moment of the Co film is
      just beginning to rotate. The identification of the higher
      coercivity part of the loop with the Co film has been
      confirmed by a study on a series of samples with different Co
      thicknesses. Similar magnetization curves were reported in
      Ref. 5 for NiFe-Cu-Co superlattices. The disappearance of the
      shoulder in the magnetization curve between 165 and 220
      &deg;C is attributed to slight interdiffusion of the Cu and
      ferromagnetic layers. Recent Auger electron spectroscopy and
      thermal energy atom scattering studies of the Co/Cu system by
      de Miguel et al.[6] show that diffusion of Cu into Co begins
      at about 177 &deg;C. No significant in-plane magnetic
      anisotropy is observed in the magnetization curves of these
      two samples despite the presence of bias fields up to 50 Oe
      during deposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="fig1.html">Figure 1(b)</a> shows magnetoresistance
      data for the same two sandwiches at room temperature. The
      magnetoresistance is here defined to be the ratio of the
      field-induced change in resistance to the zero-field
      resistance. The 220 &deg;C sample has an MR curve that is
      typical for thin ferromagnetic films, with a peak of 0.5%
      near the coercive field of the magnetization curve. For the
      165 &deg;C sandwich the peaks in the magnetoresistance
      correspond well to the region of the magnetization curve
      where the Fe and Co moments are maximally antialigned, as
      expected. The magnitude of the transverse MR at magnetic
      saturation is 3.1% for this sandwich, comparable to the
      room-temperature MR previously found for uncoupled
      sandwiches.2,3 The anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) for
      the 165 &deg;C sample was measured directly at 3 kOe to be
      0.41%. The spin-valve component of the magnetoresistance is
      the transverse MR (applied field perpendicular to the current
      direction) minus half the AMR.[7] Therefore the component of
      the MR attributable to the spin-valve effect is 2.9%. A
      spin-valve magnetoresistance of over 3% at room temperature
      can be obtained even in simple Fe-Cu-Co sandwiches by
      optimizing the deposition temperature and the layer
      thicknesses.

    <p>
      <a href="fig2.html">Figure 2</a> shows magnetoresistance data
      for two Fe51&Aring;/Cu55&Aring;/Co48&Aring; sandwiches grown
      simultaneously at 165 &deg;C, one on glass and one on Si. The
      Fe films of both samples switch between 0 and about 0.05 kOe.
      However, the Co moment in the sample grown on glass reverses
      at a significantly higher field than the Co moment in the Si
      sample, as demonstrated by the corresponding M-H loops (not
      shown). This variability in the behavior of the Co layer is
      somewhat surprising given that it is the Fe layer which is
      deposited directly on the substrate. The deposition
      temperature variation in <a href="fig1.html">Figure 1</a>
      also principally affects the behavior of the Co layer. X-ray
      diffraction and cross-sectional transmission electron
      microscopy studies are currently underway to look for
      associated structural changes in the Co film or the interface
      quality.[8]
