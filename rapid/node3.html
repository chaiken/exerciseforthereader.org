      The hydrogen-doped stage 1 KHg-GIC's described here were
      prepared in a two-step process, analogous with the
      preparation of C<sub>8</sub>KH<sub>x</sub>.[<a href=
      "node7.html#LA78">10</a>] First, three types of stage 1
      KHg-GIC's were prepared by the usual two-zone method. Two
      batches were prepared isothermally at temperatures of 200 and
      260&deg;C, respectively, and one was prepared at 200&deg;C
      with a temperature difference of 4&deg;C. As was described
      previously,[<a href="node7.html#RO84">7</a>] the two batches
      of GIC's which were prepared at 200&deg;C showed one repeat
      distance, I<sub>c</sub>, of (10.24 &plusmn; 0.03)&Aring; in
      (00<em>l</em>) x-ray scans, while those prepared at 260&deg;C
      showed two sets of Bragg peaks, one corresponding to
      I<sub>c</sub>= (10.22 &plusmn; 0.03)&Aring;, and one to
      I<sub>c</sub>= (10.83 &plusmn; 0.03)&Aring;.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to perform the hydrogen doping, the same samples
      that were characterized without hydrogen were transferred
      under vacuum to an ampoule containing 200 mbar of highly
      purified hydrogen gas. The two isothermally prepared GIC's,
      which were initially pink, became blue after about five
      minutes of exposure, and then turned a dark purple. The GIC
      which was prepared with a temperature difference was
      initially gold, but remained blue-violet indefinitely
      afterward. The superconducting transitions of all three types
      of samples were measured inductively (see Fig. 1), while the
      temperature was monitored by observation of the
      <sup>3</sup>He vapor pressure. T<sub>c</sub> was determined
      from the intersection of a tangent drawn to the transition
      curve with the level upper portion of the trace, and delta
      T<sub>c</sub> was determined by measuring the difference in
      temperature between the points where the tangent intersected
      the upper and lower levels of the traces. Subsequent
      (00<em>l</em>) scans showed that the samples' repeat
      distances were unchanged upon hydrogen doping, but the effect
      on the superconductivity was dramatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The superconducting transitions of the three types of samples
      before and after hydrogen doping are shown in Fig. 1. The
      addition of hydrogen is seen to have produced two effects.
      One is a marked narrowing of the transition width delta
      T<sub>c</sub> which occurred in all samples measured,
      especially in the one intercalated at 260&deg;C in which
      delta T<sub>c</sub> went from 0.25 K to 0.03 K (Fig. 1c). The
      other notable effect was the increase of the T<sub>c</sub> of
      all the samples to 1.5 K, except for the GIC prepared at
      200&deg;C, whose initial T<sub>c</sub> of 1.53 K was
      unchanged by hydrogen uptake (Fig. 1b). T<sub>c</sub>
      increased eighty percent in the compound prepared with a
      temperature difference, rising 0.66 K (Fig. 1a). The most
      significant result overall, though, is that the transitions
      of all three samples after hydrogen addition strongly
      resemble one another, whereas before they were quite
      distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previous work has correlated the existence of a narrow
      transition in stage 1 KHg-GIC samples with the presence of a
      well-ordered in-plane structure, probably a (2 &times; 2)
      R0&deg; phase.[<a href="node7.html#TI83">6</a>,<a href=
      "node7.html#RO84">7</a>] The initially broad transition of
      the GIC with two repeat distances is then connected with the
      presence of a second in-plane phase, possibly a (cube-root
      &times; cube-root) R30&deg; or a (cube-root &times; 2)
      R(30&deg;,0&deg;) structure,[<a href="node7.html#RO84">7</a>]
      or a disordered structure. Experiments with the application
      of external pressure to KHg-GIC's have produced a sharpening
      of the superconducting transition[<a href=
      "node7.html#DE83">5</a>] apparently similar to that produced
      by hydrogen doping. The effect of pressure seems to be the
      formation of a more homogeneous intercalate structure. The
      transition-narrowing seen in association with hydrogen
      exposure must also be due to greater uniformity, probably
      caused by hydrogen diffusion into mercury vacancies
      associated with disorder. Rapid diffusion of hydrogen atoms
      is very plausible because of their small size, and is well
      known to occur in other metallic systems.[<a href=
      "node7.html#VO78">12</a>] The total hydrogen uptake may then
      be limited by the number of available vacant Hg sites, or it
      may be determined by electronic effects, as in
      KH<sub>x</sub>-GIC's, where the maximum possible value of
      x=0.8 is limited by the finite number of electrons available
      for transfer to the hydrogen.[<a href=
      "node7.html#EN85">13</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Charge transfer to hydrogen is also to be expected in doped
      stage 1 KHg-GIC samples because of hydrogen's high electron
      affinity. The filling of low-lying hydrogen states must
      remove electrons from intercalate and graphite bands and thus
      lower the Fermi energy. In the KH-GIC's, the transfer of
      electrons from potassium to hydrogenic states has already
      been directly observed using ESR[<a href=
      "node7.html#EN82">14</a>] and <sup>13</sup>C NMR.[<a href=
      "node7.html#CO81">15</a>] Moreover, recent Shubnikov-de Haas
      measurements on these compounds show them to have a lower
      Fermi energy than the parent compound, C<sub>8</sub>K.[<a
      href="node7.html#EN85">13</a>] To see how the change in
      electronic occupation might affect the transition temperature
      of the KHg-GIC's, we can refer to the BCS theory of
      superconductivity, in which the superconducting transition
      temperature increases with increasing density of states at
      the Fermi level according to T<sub>c</sub> =1.14
      theta<sub>D</sub> exp [- 1/N(E<sub>f</sub>)V]. Here
      theta<sub>D</sub> is the Debye temperature, N(E<sub>f</sub>)
      is the density of states at the Fermi level, and V is the
      electron-phonon coupling matrix element. We see that if the
      rise in the transition temperature with the uptake of
      hydrogen is due to a change in the density of states, then
      the experimentally observed decrease in E<sub>f</sub> must
      lead to an increase in N(E<sub>f</sub>). The effect of
      hydrogen on the three types of samples can then be explained
      using the schematic density of states curves for the normal
      state compound shown in Fig. 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Figure 2a displays the form proposed for the density of
      states of a KHg-GIC with T<sub>c</sub> less than 1.5 K. There
      are small contributions from the graphite bonding pi and
      antibonding pi<sup>*</sup> bands, but the density of states
      is dominated by s-like and p-like bands due to potassium and
      mercury. Note that the Fermi level is above a local maximum
      in the schematic density of states of the intercalate-derived
      bands. The basic shape of the density of states is consistent
      with recent EELS experiments which found strong evidence for
      the presence of mercury-like and potassium-like contributions
      to N(E<sub>f</sub>).[<a href="node7.html#PR84">16</a>] Figure
      2b shows the final configuration for a hydrogenated stage 1
      KHg-GIC. Now the Fermi level is lower because of electron
      transfer from the intercalate and graphite bands into the
      hydrogen states, but the density of states at the Fermi level
      is higher. A GIC whose T<sub>c</sub> was unchanged from 1.5 K
      by hydrogenation must have had its N(E<sub>f</sub>) near that
      indicated in Fig. 2b before doping. Therefore one concludes
      that either its hydrogen absorption and associated Fermi
      level shift must have been small, or that its Fermi level
      lies near a broad local maximum in the density of states. Low
      hydrogen uptake for samples with an undoped T<sub>c</sub> of
      1.5 K is consistent with the observation that their color
      change after hydrogenation was less noticeable than that of
      the GIC's with a lower undoped T<sub>c</sub>.<br />
