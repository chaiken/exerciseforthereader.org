    <p>
      One particularly active area of research in recent years has
      been the study of the effects of hydrogen absorption on
      metals.[<a href="node7.html#TO78">1</a>] Among the many
      results of hydrogen uptake are changes in superconductivity.
      For example, in some transition metals hydrogen absorption
      causes an increase in the superconducting transition
      temperature, T<sub>c</sub>, while in others T<sub>c</sub>
      decreases upon hydrogenation.[<a href=
      "node7.html#ST78">2</a>] The introduction of hydrogen has
      previously been shown to increase the transition temperature
      of one graphite intercalation compound, C<sub>8</sub>K.[<a
      href="node7.html#KA82">3</a>] The transition temperature
      depends strongly on the details of the band structure near
      the Fermi level. Therefore one cannot generalize from a
      single example about the effect of hydrogenation on other
      graphite intercalation compounds, just as it was difficult to
      generalize about the transition metals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage 1 potassium-mercury graphite intercalation
      compounds (KHg-GIC's) are especially interesting from the
      standpoint of superconductivity. Discussions of the nature of
      the superconductivity in these compounds have been greatly
      complicated by widely varying values reported for the
      superconducting transition temperature, T<sub>c</sub>, which
      have ranged from the 0.8 K initially found[<a href=
      "node7.html#IY82">4</a>] up to 1.5 K both with[<a href=
      "node7.html#DE83">5</a>] and without[<a href=
      "node7.html#TI83">6</a>] the application of external
      pressure. Structural and stoichiometric distinctions between
      samples have been cited as the source of variation among
      them. Previous attempts to understand the differences between
      samples focused on their intercalation conditions.[<a href=
      "node7.html#RO84">7</a>] These experiments were limited by
      the indirect nature of the connection between the preparation
      parameters and the final properties of the GIC.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this work we describe the application of hydrogen-doping
      as a new probe of the relationship between structure and
      superconductivity in stage 1 KHg-GIC's. In contrast to other
      experiments relevant to the superconductivity of this
      compound, exposure to hydrogen yields a result which is
      reproducible not only among similarly prepared samples, but
      among stage 1 KHg-GIC's with a wide range of initial
      properties. Therefore this technique may properly be used to
      study the characteristics of stage 1 KHg-GIC's (denoted by
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg when stoichiometric[<a href=
      "node7.html#MA80">8</a>]) without reference to the history of
      a particular sample. It is remarkable in this context to note
      that the uniformity of superconducting properties is achieved
      not by degrading all compounds to the level of the most
      disordered GIC, but by elevating all of them to the quality
      of the best ordered ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally the stage 1 KHg-GIC has been discussed in
      conjunction with the corresponding stage 2 compound because
      of the surprising finding that stage 2 has a higher
      T<sub>c</sub> than stage 1, despite specific heat
      measurements which indicate that stage 2 has a lower density
      of states at the Fermi level.[<a href=
      "node7.html#AL80">9</a>] In this context, a comparison with
      the potassium hydride graphite intercalation compounds should
      also prove instructive. One reason is that
      C<sub>8</sub>KH<sub>2/3</sub> has a triple-intercalate-layer
      structure[<a href="node7.html#LA78">10</a>] similar to that
      of potassium-mercury GIC's.[<a href="node7.html#MA80">8</a>]
      Also significant as far as superconductivity is concerned is
      that the T<sub>c</sub> of C<sub>8</sub>KH<sub>0.19</sub> is
      0.22 K,[<a href="node7.html#KA82">3</a>] fifty percent higher
      than that of its parent compound, C<sub>8</sub>K, with a
      T<sub>c</sub> of 0.15 K.[<a href="node7.html#KO78">11</a>]
