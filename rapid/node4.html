    <p>
      Further evidence that the role of hydrogen in stage 1
      KHg-GIC's is to accept electrons comes from an examination of
      the effect of stoichiometry on the superconductivity of KHg
      alloys. In these compounds, T<sub>c</sub> decreases
      monotonically with increasing potassium content, from 4.2 K
      in pure mercury to 0.9 K in KHg itself.[<a href=
      "node7.html#RO76">17</a>,<a href="node7.html#TA81">18</a>]
      These data provide strong support for the idea that adding
      electrons to Hg decreases rather than increases the
      transition temperature. One can then think of the carbon
      layers in the potassium-mercury graphite intercalation
      compounds as a sink for some of the intercalant electrons,
      and use this idea to explain why T<sub>c</sub> is higher in
      stage 1 KHg-GIC's than it is in the KHg alloy. The hypothesis
      that hydrogen increases the transition temperature by
      removing electrons from the intercalate bands is then fully
      consistent.

      The density of states model described above could also be
      extended to treat stage 2 KHg-GIC's. Several different
      experiments show that the Fermi level in stage 2 is about 0.5
      eV lower than in stage 1.[<a href="node7.html#CO81">15</a>,<a
      href="node7.html#PR84">16</a>,<a href=
      "node7.html#TI84">19</a>] The finding that T<sub>c</sub> =
      1.9 K is higher in stage 2 than in stage 1 may indicate that
      the same type of density of states shift that occurs upon
      hydrogenation also occurs from stage 1 to stage 2. This
      conclusion is supported by EELS data which indicates that the
      density of intercalate states is higher in stage 2.[<a href=
      "node7.html#PR84">16</a>] The EELS result is apparently in
      conflict with the finding from specific heat measurements
      that the total N(E<sub>f</sub>) decreases substantially from
      stage 1 to stage 2.[<a href="node7.html#AL80">9</a>] The
      conflict stems from the fact that for the two results to be
      consistent, one must assign a contribution to
      N(E<sub>f</sub>) from the graphite pi bands which is an order
      of magnitude larger than that expected for the graphite pi
      bands at this Fermi level.[<a href="node7.html#TI84">19</a>]
      The seeming discrepancy between the density of states model
      and the specific heat measurements can be resolved by noting
      that the stage 1 GIC used for the specific heat measurement
      was found to be not superconducting down to 0.8 K.[<a href=
      "node7.html#AL80">9</a>] Therefore the upper limit on the
      transition temperature of the GIC used in the specific heat
      experiment is below the lowest T<sub>c</sub> measured for any
      of the samples described in the present work, which implies
      that the electronic structure of that compound may well have
      been different from that of the GIC's described here. If this
      assertion be correct, then other experiments present a
      unified picture of the behavior of the density of states in
      these compounds.
