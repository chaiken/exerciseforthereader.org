      Multilayer films made by alternate deposition of two
      materials play an important role in electronic and optical
      devices such as quantum-well lasers and x-ray mirrors.[1] In
      addition, novel phenomena like giant magnetoresistance and
      dimensional crossover in superconductors have emerged from
      studies of multilayers. While sophisticated x-ray techniques
      are widely used to study the morphology of multilayer films,
      progress in studying the electronic structure has been
      slower. The short mean-free path of low-energy electrons
      severely limits the usefulness of photoemission and related
      electron spectroscopies for multilayer studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soft x-ray fluorescence (SXF) is a bulk-sensitive photon-in,
      photon-out method to study valence band electronic states.[2]
      Near-edge x-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy
      (NEXAFS) measured with partial photon yield can give
      complementary bulk-sensitive information about unoccupied
      states.[3] Both these methods are element-specific since the
      incident x-ray photons excite electrons from core levels. By
      combining NEXAFS and SXF measurements on buried layers in
      multilayers and comparing these spectra to data on
      appropriate reference compounds, it is possible to obtain a
      detailed picture of the electronic structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fe/Si multilayer system well illustrates the power of
      combining the SXF and NEXAFS techniques. Fe/Si multilayers
      exhibit a large antiferromagnetic (AF) interlayer exchange
      coupling that is apparently similar to that previously
      observed in metal/metal multilayers like Fe/Cr.[4] The
      observation of strong antiferromagnetic coupling was
      initially surprising, since this coupling is believed to be a
      manifestation of spin-density oscillations in the
      non-magnetic metallic spacer layer of a multilayer.[5] The
      interpretation of the Fe/Si coupling data was hampered by
      lack of knowledge about the strongly intermixed iron silicide
      spacer layer, which was variously hypothesized to be a
      metallic compound in the B2 CsCl structure[4] or a Kondo
      insulator in the more complex B20 structure.[6] If the spacer
      layer is not metallic, then the usual theories of interlayer
      exchange coupling do not apply[5] and the coupling must
      involve a novel mechanism. Using transmission electron
      microscopy (TEM), the spacer layer has been identified as a
      metastable cubic iron silicide closely lattice-matched to
      bulk Fe.[7] However, since the exact stoichiometry of the
      silicide was not determinable by diffraction means, the
      question of whether the spacer layer is a metal or not has
      remained unanswerable. SXF and NEXAFS are ideal techniques to
      resolve exactly this type of issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      SXF and NEXAFS measurements were performed on five different
      Fe/Si multilayer films at the Advanced Light Source on
      beamline 8.0, which is described in detail elsewhere.[8] SXF
      data has previously been used to study buried layers of BN[9]
      and Si.[10] Data taken at the Fe L-edge closely resembles
      bulk Fe for all Fe/Si multilayers. NEXAFS spectra were
      acquired by measuring the total Si L-emission yield with the
      same detector used for fluorescence. The resulting data are
      expected to be comparable to those acquired by electron
      counting.[3] The films used in this study were grown using
      ion-beam sputtering (IBS) in a chamber with a base pressure
      of 2&times;10<sup>-8</sup> torr. The deposition conditions
      were the same as those used in previous studies.[8] All
      multilayers were characterized using x-ray diffraction and
      magnetometry. Reference spectra were obtained from a
      crystalline silicon (c-Si) substrate piece, an amorphous
      silicon (a-Si) film made by IBS, and a fragment of an
      FeSi<sub>2</sub> sputter target.
