      SXF data have also been taken on an Fe/Si multilayer with
      t<sub>Si</sub> = 14&Aring; but which was held at a reduced
      temperature of 120 K during growth (data not shown). The
      valence band spectra of the film grown at reduced temperature
      with t<sub>Si</sub> = 14&Aring; look virtually identical to
      data on the film grown at 60&deg;C but with t<sub>Si</sub> =
      20&Aring;. The most likely explanation for this similarity is
      that both films have amorphous iron silicide spacer layers.
      The amorphous state of the spacer layer in these films must
      be due to the reduced Fe content compared with films which
      have thinner Si layers or are deposited at higher
      temperature. Multilayers with amorphous spacer layers do not
      display antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling.[4,7]
    </p>
    <p>
      A comparison of the data of Figs. <a href="fig3.html">3</a>
      and <a href="fig4.html">4</a> show that the peaks in the
      spectrum of the epitaxial AF-coupled multilayer are narrower
      than those in the spectrum of the polycrystalline AF-coupled
      multilayer. This suggests that a higher degree of local order
      occurs in epitaxial films. The nature of this order and the
      exact structure of the silicide spacer layer phase are not
      yet known. TEM studies have shown that the spacer layer in
      AF-coupled multilayers is a crystalline cubic iron silicide
      in the B2 CsCl phase or fcc DO<sub>3</sub> phase.[7] The TEM
      diffraction patterns are not consistent with the B20
      structure, whose SXF data most closely resembles that of the
      AF-coupled multilayers. Jia <em>et al.</em> do report SXF
      data on the DO<sub>3</sub>-structure Fe<sub>3</sub>Si phase
      but the spectrum of this compound has a much more prominent
      and narrow non-bonding <strong>s</strong> feature.[11] The
      presence of an Fe<sub>3</sub>Si spacer can be ruled out on
      other grounds since this compound is ferromagnetic,
      inconsistent with the presence of antiferromagnetic
      interlayer coupling. The possibility remains, however, that
      the spacer layer is in the DO<sub>3</sub> structure but at a
      different stoichiometry. No SXF data on the metastable B2
      silicide phase have been reported although photoemission
      measurements show that it is metallic.[13] The magnetic
      properties of the B2 phase and hypothetical off-stoichiometry
      phases are not known. The observation of large biquadratic
      coupling in Fe/Si multilayers[14,15] suggests that an
      antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic order may be present in
      the spacer layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When examined together, the SXF and NEXAFS data show that
      Fe/Si multilayers with crystalline metallic silicide spacer
      layers have antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, while
      similar multilayers with amorphous silicide spacer layers
      show no interlayer coupling. Whether the amorphous silicide
      layers are metallic or semiconducting is a topic for further
      study. Theoretical calculations will be necessary to get a
      better estimate of the stoichiometry and magnetic properties
      of the silicide spacer in the AF-coupled multilayers. The
      present data should lay to rest any speculation that the
      interlayer exchange coupling in Fe/Si multilayers involves a
      novel mechanism. The clarity of these results on thin buried
      silicide layers illustrates the power of photon-counting
      spectroscopies with their intrinsic bulk sensitivity for the
      study of multilayer films.
