<h3>The new (2009) <a
      href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596523206/">Geek Atlas</a>
      written by kindred spirit John Graham-Cumming lists six Bay Area
      places, only one of which I had already included here.</h3> 
    <hr />
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Tour the <a href="http://www.geysers.com/">Geysers</a>,
          Calpine's geothermal generation plant in Middletown, Lake
          County. See giant turbines and clouds of sulfuric acid
          steam! The link is, ahem, optimized for a non-Mozilla
          browser, so you can also call toll-free (866)-GEYSERS for
          more information.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Visit the <a href=
          "http://www.nummi.com/tours.html">GM-Toyota NUMMI auto
          manufacturing plant</a> in southern Fremont. There are
          fascinating robot welders and giant metal stampers. The
          tour is quite suitable for children in my unexpert
          opinion.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Particle accelerators are big fun. Consider an outing to the
          <a href= "http://www.lbl.gov/Community/tours.html">Advanced
          Light Source</a> in Berkeley or the <a href=
          "http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/tours/">Stanford
          Linear Accelerator</a>.  The LBNL tour may also visit other
          facilities such as the National Center for Electron
          Microscopy, the Environmental Energy Technologies Division
          and the Center for Beam Physics.

          For more gigantic steel structures, check out the <a
          href="http://www.portofoakland.com/communit/serv_tour.asp">
          Port of Oakland</a> tour. Enjoy giant cranes and a boat ride
          too. (Thanks to <a href= "http://xom.blogs.com/">Meg</a>.)
          To get an even closer look at the cranes (and a fine view of
          San Francisco as well), walk around and have a picnic at <a
          href="http://www.ebparks.org/parks/midlhar.htm">Middle

          The <a href="http://online.wr.usgs.gov/">Menlo Park branch
          of the USGS</a> is a reliable source of entertainment. Every
          couple of years there's an <a href=
          "http://openhouse.wr.usgs.gov/">Open House</a>. In the
          meantime browse the quads, fault maps and satellite photos
          at the <a
          href="http://geography.usgs.gov/esic/esic_index.html#mp">Earth
          Science Information Center,</a> which is located in Building

          Meditate on earthquakes while hiking the <a href=
          "http://www.bahiker.com/southbayhikes/lostrancos.html">San
          Andreas Fault Trail</a> in Palo Alto or seeing the Loma
          Prieta Epicenter in <a href=
          "http://www.santacruzstateparks.org/parks/nisene/index.php">
          Forest of Nisene Marks</a>.  (I'll confess that the Nisene
          Marks hike is a bit dull: miles and miles of trail through
          dark second-growth redwood forest.)  Many more
          earthquake-related outings are described in <a href=
          "http://www.boredfeet.com/singles2/geologysf.php">Geologic
          Trips: San Francisco and the Bay Area</a>, which I highly
          recommend.  Another book of interest is <a

          The <a href="http://www.hiller.org/">Hiller Aviation
          Museum</a> specializes in early helicopters which range
          from the admirable to the laughable. The annual <a href=

          The <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/">Computer

          Besides the <a href=

          "http://www.csrmf.org/pt_style.asp">California State Railroad
          Museum</a> looks appealing. Of course you could take the
          remarkably scenic and comfortable <a
          href="http://www.amtrakcapitols.com/">Amtrak Capitol
          Corridor line</a> to get there. Closer to home you can ride

          No matter how you feel about our California water politics,
          the acqueducts and dams are certainly an engineering
          marvel. The <a href=
          "http://www.sunol.org/temple.html">Sunol
          water temple</a> is open 9 AM to 3 PM Monday through Friday.
          The similar Pulgas Water Temple, adjacent to the Crystal
          Springs Reservoir, has more reasonable hours but <a href=

          In the recent past I've seen advertisements for tours of
          the Altamont windfarm and the Cargill salt processing
          facility in Newark, but I can no longer find information
          about these excursions. Anyone?
