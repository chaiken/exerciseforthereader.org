    <p>
      Since the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) of Fe/Cr multilayers
      was discovered by Baibich et al. in 1989,[1] scientists
      around the world have made great strides towards
      understanding the fundamental physics of this phenomenon.
      There have been dozens of experimental studies. Theorists
      have studied the magnitude of the magnetoresistance as a
      function of layer thickness,[2,3,4] interface morphology,[2]
      temperature,[5,6] configuration of the magnetic moments in
      the layers,[7] and impurity scattering,[8] all with some
      degree of success. In these models, the microscopic
      parameters which describe the detailed electronic potential
      of the metallic layers and their interfaces have often been
      lumped into phenomenological spin-dependent mean-free paths
      or transmission coefficients. This approach has been
      successful in describing the layer-thickness dependence and
      temperature dependence of the magnetoresistance, but it does
      not explain why some ferromagnet/paramagnet multilayers
      intrinsically have larger magnetoresistance than others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently a pair of theoretical attempts have been made to
      relate the size of the magnetoresistance to band-structure
      parameters.[4,9] These efforts took very different
      approaches, one emphasing the density of states in the
      ferromagnetic layers,[4] and another emphasizing band offsets
      at the ferromagnet/paramagnet interface.[9] The question of
      which microscopic properties of the ferromagnet and
      paramagnet affect the size of the GMR in a given multilayer
      system remains an open one although it is of great importance
      both for fundamental reasons and for applications. The
      intellectual problem can be succintly put forth by noting
      that the magnetoresistance is large in the Fe/Cr[1] and
      Co/Cu[10] systems, but small in the Co/Cr[11] and Fe/Cu[12]
      systems. Another suggestive series of experiments has been
      performed by B. Dieny et al. on NiFe/Cu/ferromagnet
      sandwiches[13,14] where the type of ferromagnet in the second
      magnetic layer was varied. In these studies, a sandwich with
      a second NiFe layer has a smaller GMR than one with a Co
      layer, while the GMR of a sandwich with a Ni layer is smaller
      yet. Most recently, Saito and coworkers have found that the
      GMR is larger in Co<sub>9</sub>Fe/Cu multilayers than in
      Co/Cu multilayers or Co<sub>3</sub>Fe /Cu multilayers.[15]
    </p>
    <p>
      Practical issues related to crystal structure and growth
      morphology tend to complicate the interpretation of the
      multilayer and sandwich data. After all, Cu and Co are
      typically fcc in the sputtered superlattice structures,
      whereas Fe and Cr are typically bcc. Therefore one might
      suppose that the GMR is larger in the all-bcc and all-fcc
      superlattices, and smaller in those with mixed crystal
      structures. However, this hypothesis does nothing to explain
      the extensive data of Dieny and coworkers[13,14] since their
      Cu, NiFe, Co and Ni are all presumably fcc. In the
      Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub>/Cu multilayer work of Saito et
      al.,[15] both fcc and hcp Co were observed in all 3 types of
      samples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of the maximum size of the magnetoresistance in
      a given ferromagnet/paramagnet system deserves more attention
      from both theorists and experimentalists. ("Maximum size"
      here means the room temperature magnitude of the
      magnetoresistance at the paramagnet and ferromagnet
      thicknesses which give the largest effect.) Ideally one would
      like to eliminate any issues about crystal structure and
      growth morphology in order to define clearly the relationship
      between band-structure effects and the GMR. One way of
      minimizing such concerns is to study the
      Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub> alloy system, which can be
      grown epitaxially in the bcc crystal structure throughout the
      range of composition.[16] In order to explore a possible link
      between electronic structure and GMR, a series of
      Fe/Ag/Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub>/Ag sandwiches have been
      grown with different Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub>
      stoichiometries, and their transport properties have been
      studied.<br />
