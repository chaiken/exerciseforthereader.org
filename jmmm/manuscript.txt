The magnitude of the giant or spin-valve magnetoresistance in 
ferromagnet/paramagnet/ferromagnet sandwiches depends on the choice of 
ferromagnet.    In this study, the dependence of the giant magnetoresistance on 
the composition of the alloy layer in a series of  Fe/Ag/CoxFe1-x sandwiches has 
been varied in order to get some insight into the fundamental origin of the effect.    
The CoxFe1-x alloy layers can be grown in the bcc phase throughout the range 0 ≤ 
x ≤ 1 using molecular beam epitaxy.      The anisotropic magnetoresistance of 
these sandwiches shows a simple linear  dependence on x, the Co fraction, but 
the giant magnetoresistance has a non-monotonic composition dependence.



1. Introduction

Since  the  giant magnetoresistance  (GMR) of  Fe/Cr multilayers was discovered 
by Baibich et al. in 1989, 1    scientists around the world have made great strides 
towards understanding the fundamental physics of this phenomenon.     There 
have been dozens of experimental studies.     Theorists have studied the  
magnitude of the magnetoresistance as a function of  layer thickness, 2, 3, 4  
interface morphology, 2  temperature, 5, 6  configuration of the magnetic moments 
in the layers, 7  and impurity scattering, 8   all with some  degree of success.      In 
these models, the microscopic  parameters  which describe the detailed electronic 
potential of the metallic layers  and their interfaces have often been lumped into 
phenomenological spin-dependent  mean-free paths or  transmission coefficients.    
This approach has been successful in describing the  layer-thickness dependence 
and temperature dependence of the magnetoresistance, but it  does not explain 
why some ferromagnet/paramagnet multilayers intrinsically have larger 
magnetoresistance than others.     

Recently  a pair of  theoretical attempts have been made  to relate the size of the 
magnetoresistance to band-structure parameters. 4, 9    These efforts took very 
different approaches, one emphasing the density of states in the ferromagnetic 
layers, 4  and another emphasizing band offsets at the ferromagnet/paramagnet 
interface. 9      The question of which microscopic properties of the ferromagnet 
and paramagnet  affect the size of the GMR in a given multilayer system remains 
an open one although it is of great importance both for fundamental reasons and 
for applications.      The intellectual problem can be succintly put forth by noting 
that the magnetoresistance is large in the Fe/Cr 1  and Co/Cu 10  systems, but 
small in the Co/Cr 11  and Fe/Cu 12  systems.      Another suggestive series of 
experiments has been performed by B. Dieny et al.  on  NiFe/Cu/ferromagnet 
sandwiches 13, 14  where the type of ferromagnet in the second magnetic layer 
was varied.    In these studies,  a sandwich with a second NiFe layer  has a 
smaller GMR than one with a Co layer, while the GMR of a  sandwich  with a Ni 
layer  is smaller  yet.    Most recently, Saito and coworkers have found that the 
GMR is larger in Co9Fe/Cu multilayers than in Co/Cu multilayers or Co3Fe /Cu 
multilayers. 15 

Practical issues related to crystal structure  and growth morphology tend to 
complicate the interpretation of the multilayer and sandwich data.      After all, 
Cu and Co are typically fcc in the sputtered superlattice structures, whereas Fe 
and Cr are typically bcc.      Therefore one might suppose that the GMR is larger 
in the all-bcc and all-fcc superlattices,  and smaller in those with mixed crystal 
structures.     However, this hypothesis does nothing to explain the extensive 
data of Dieny and coworkers 13, 14  since their Cu, NiFe, Co and Ni are all 
presumably fcc.      In the CoxFe1-x/Cu multilayer work of Saito et al., 15  both fcc 
and hcp Co were observed in all  3 types of samples.

The question of  the maximum size of the magnetoresistance in a given 
ferromagnet/paramagnet system deserves more attention from both theorists 
and experimentalists.      ("Maximum size" here means the room temperature 
magnitude of the magnetoresistance at the paramagnet and ferromagnet 
thicknesses which give the largest effect.)   Ideally one would like to eliminate 
any issues about crystal structure and growth morphology in order to define 
clearly the relationship between band-structure effects and  the GMR.      One 
way of minimizing such concerns is to study the CoxFe1-x alloy system, which 
can be  grown  epitaxially in the  bcc crystal structure throughout the range of 
composition. 16      In order to explore a possible link between electronic structure 
and GMR,  a series of Fe/Ag/CoxFe1-x/Ag sandwiches have been grown with 
different CoxFe1-x stoichiometries, and their transport properties have been 
studied.


2. Sandwich Growth and Experimental Details

The sandwiches used in this study were grown by molecular beam epitaxy using  
elemental sources.    First, a ZnSe buffer layer a few thousand angstroms thick 
was deposited on a semi-insulating (100) GaAs substrate.    Then the  sandwich 
layers of Fe, Ag,  and CoFe alloy were sequentially deposited on the ZnSe layer, 
in each case maintaining good epitaxial registry with the substrate.   Finally  a 
thin Ag or Al cap layer was deposited on each  sample to prevent oxidation.      
The first Fe layer was always grown with a slightly elevated substrate 
temperature of 175 °C in order to optimize crystalline perfection, 17  but 
subsequent layers were  grown with the substrate cooled to -10 to -20 °C to 
minimize interdiffusion.      Auger electron spectroscopy at each stage of growth 
showed that C and O contamination was less than 1%.

Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) camera photographs of the 
surface at various stages of the growth are shown in Fig. 1.       The photographs 
show that the first Fe layer goes down in the (001) orientation, as has been 
demonstrated previously. 17      The Ag and CoxFe1-x layers also go down in the  
(001) orientation, with the alloy layer in the bcc phase for all compositions 
despite the fact that at room temperature bulk CoxFe1-x is mixed-phase for Co 
fractions greater than x = 0.75. 18       The RHEED pattern for the pure Co film   
suggest that the surface  is rough, and that there are crystalline defects.    
However, the  symmetry of this film is  clearly cubic, as demonstrated both by 
the RHEED pattern and by angle-dependent ferromagnetic resonance 
measurements  which are described further below.  A total of five 
Fe/Ag/CoxFe1-x sandwiches were grown with alloy compositions ranging from 
pure Fe (x = 0) to pure Co (x = 1).

Flux rates during growth were monitored using a calibrated UTI 100C 
quadropole mass analyzer.   The total thickness of the deposited metal was 
measured by x-ray fluorescence  (XRF) spectroscopy.      The nominal thicknesses 
of the corresponding layers were kept constant from sample to sample at (Fe 
80Å/Ag 60Å/CoxFe1-x 80Å/Ag 20Å).    Actual layer thicknesses and alloy 
compositions were calculated by combining  XRF and integrated Auger 
intensities measurements.

Using well-established analysis methods, 19  the angular dependence of the 35 
GHz ferromagnetic resonance field was used to determine the 
magnetocrystalline anisotropy of each magnetic layer in each sample.    
Measured layer thicknesses and anisotropies  are given in Table I.    Results for 
the plain Fe films were similar to those previously observed for Fe on  ZnSe. 19    
Magnetic hysteresis loops were taken using a vibrating-sample magnetometer 
(VSM).   Magnetoresistance measurements were made using Ag paint or pressed 
In contacts placed at the two ends of  2mm  by 1cm  strips cleaved off  the 
original 1 cm  by 1 cm wafer.     Several samples were measured with both types 
of contacts, and no difference was observed.   The measurement current  was 
always along the GaAs [110] direction and the applied field always in-plane.        
All measurements were performed at room temperature.     The sandwiches  had 
resistivities in the range 15 ± 5 mW-cm with no systematic trend versus alloy 
composition.

3. Results

 At the chosen Ag spacer thickness of about 60Å, ferromagnetic resonance shows 
no measurable antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling  between the Fe layer and 
the alloy layer, consistent with previous results on Ag-spacer systems. 20, 21       
The qualitative features of the magnetization curves are expected to evolve in a 
complex way as a function of  composition since the four-fold magnetocrystalline 
anisotropy  (K1) of  bulk CoxFe1-x alloys changes from positive at x = 0 (pure Fe) 
to zero near x = 0.4 to negative near the bulk limit of the bcc phase at x = 0.7. 22       
The values of K1 for the Fe/Ag/CoxFe1-x  sandwiches are gathered in Table I.      
They are in generally good agreement with bulk values.    The anisotropy of 
CoxFe-1-x films as a function of  composition is discussed in more detail in Ref. 16.

 A VSM loop of the sample with a pure Co layer is shown in Fig. 2a).     Previous 
experience with films of bcc Co   has  shown 23  it to have a large negative four-
fold anisotropy K1 =  -6.6x105 erg/cm3, so one anticipates that a Co film will 
have a <110> easy axis in the (001) plane.     In fact, the Co film in the Fe/Ag/Co 
sandwich has a <100> easy axis and a large positive K1.     The reason for this 
discrepancy is not clear.     The Co film does have a bigger coercivity than the Fe, 
as would be expected given its much larger anisotropy. 22 

Due to the difference in their coercivities, the moments of the Fe and Co layers 
are antiparallel for the field range  (Hc,Fe = 0.015 kOe ) < |H| < (Hc,Co = 0.470 
kOe).     As has been shown previously, 13, 24, 25  the antiparallel orientation of the 
magnetic moments in different layers is sufficient to cause the  occurrence of the 
giant or spin-valve magnetoresistance.      Figure 2b) shows the 
magnetoresistance data for the same Fe/Ag/Co sandwich whose magnetization 
curve is shown  in Fig 2a).      As expected, the resistance is maximum in the 
applied field region where |H| is less than the Co coercive field but greater than 
the Fe coercive field.     The origin of the small shoulders in the MR near H ≈ 
±0.38 kOe is harder to explain.    These features may indicate that the Co film is 
reversing in two sequential 90˚ steps since the shoulders are near the halfway 
point.   However, the easy-axis magnetization reversal of a thin film with cubic 
anisotropy usually occurs by the motion of 180° walls, not 90° domain walls. 22      

The Fe/Ag/Co71Fe29 sandwich whose magnetization data is displayed in Figure 
3a) is quite different.   Since the Co-rich alloy layer has a negative K1, its easy 
direction in the (001) plane is a <110> axis.     Therefore the <100> magnetization 
curve in Fig. 3a) is an easy loop for the Fe film, but a hard loop for the alloy film.    
Knowing this we can easily see that the low-field square reversal with Hc ≈ 0.04 
kOe is attributable to Fe, while the higher-field linear magnetization 
characteristic corresponds to the CoxFe1-x layer.   Because there is no significant 
interlayer magnetic coupling, the moments in each of the layers should each lie 
along their own easy axes at zero applied field, meaning that at H=0 there is a 45° 
angle between the Fe and CoxFe1-x moments.    

The low-field magnetization behavior  of the same sample is shown in more 
detail in Fig. 3b).       As was mentioned previously, easy axis magnetization 
reversal in cubic-anisotropy materials generally proceeds by the motion of 180° 
domain walls. 22   The Fe magnetization curve therefore has a feature only at Hc, 
the coercive field.   Hard axis reversal, on the other hand, should have the 
following steps as the applied field is decreased from a high value: first, 
reversible domain rotation of 45° from the hard axis to the easy axis; next, after 
the applied field reverses, motion of 90° domain walls or irreversible 90° rotation; 
lastly, reversible rotation  45° from the reversed easy axis to the hard direction 
along the applied field.    All these features are observed in the hard-axis reversal 
of the alloy film in Fig. 3b).     The moment of the alloy film jumps 90° from one 
(110) axis to the other at a larger absolute field value than that at which the Fe 
film's moment reverses  by 180° from one (100) direction to the other.    Since the 
magnetometer measures only the component of the moment along the applied 
field, the 90° jump is positively identifiable as the smaller of the two low-field 
discontinuities of the moment in Fig. 3b).    Fig. 3c) shows that, as expected, there 
is a magnetization peak in the field region where  there is a maximum angle of 
135° between the alloy-film moment and the Fe film moment.    

As Figure 4 shows,  data for the Fe/Ag/Fe sandwich (x = 0) is  surprising.      
There is only one ferromagnetic resonance line  for this sandwich, in contrast to 
the two resonances observed when x≠ 0, so  that the magnetocrystalline 
anisotropies of the two films appear to be identical.     Previous work has shown 
that K1 in Fe films on ZnSe and Ag is not very sensitive to disorder, but that the 
coercive field Hc may be  affected. 19   Broader RHEED streaks from the top Fe  
film  indicate it has more defects than  the lower Fe film, so  a different coercivity 
for this film seems reasonable.    From the general considerations described 
above, one can then attribute the lower-field peak in the magnetoresistance in 
Fig. 4b) to the film's moment irreversibly rotating 90° before the other film's.        
We therefore expect the angular separation of the Fe moments at the MR peak to 
be 90°.

Clearly the higher-field magnetoresistance "2nd peak" in Fig. 4b) cannot be so 
easily explained.        In order to understand the origin of the second peak, which 
does not correspond to any discernible feature in Fig. 4a), it is necessary to recall 
that the vibrating sample magnetometer only measures the component of the 
magnetization along the applied field.    Thus the reversal of a component of the 
magnetization which is orthogonal to the applied field will not show up in a 
VSM loop.     Florczak and Dahlberg have suggested that in  thin (001) Fe films a 
small misalignment of the applied field from the hard <110> axis causes the 
magnetization reversal  to occur as two 90° irreversible rotations. 26    The reason 
is that the moment then has two hard-axis energy barriers to surmount in order 
to complete a reversal.   The second of the two  transitions is unobservable in a 
VSM experiment because the  component of magnetization perpendicular to the 
applied field reverses. 26        In keeping with this hypothesis, the higher-field 
magnetoresistance peak of Fig. 4b) may well  coincide with a second 90° 
irreversible rotation by one of the Fe moments.    The field at which the second 
MR jump occurs is in good agreement with the field at which Florczak and 
Dahlberg observed the reversal of the perpendicular component of the Fe 
magnetization using the Kerr effect. 26        In this picture, the higher-field MR 
peak is smaller than the lower-field peak because both moments have already 
rotated further toward the hard axis at the field where the second jump occurs.   
This leads to an angular separation of the moments less than 90° at the second 
peak, and thus a smaller resistance change.


4. Discussion
	The field dependence of the magnetoresistance has been obtained from the 
raw  data using the definition

                    . 	(1)

As has been detailed before, 13, 25  the angular dependence of the giant 
magnetoresistance is described by

                    	(2)

where  (q1 - q2) is the relative orientation of the moments of the two magnetic 
films and  G   is the coefficient of giant magnetoresistance.    The term that 
describes the angular dependence of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) 
has been omitted from equation (2).     The AMR is the magnetoresistance that is 
characteristic of the individual films. 27         The magnitude of the AMR can be 
separately determined at high field where the GMR term doesn't contribute 
because (q1 - q2)   = 0. 25      The maximum MR for each sample minus the AMR 
contribution is listed in Table II as   MRpeak.     The AMR is also listed in Table II 
for each sandwich.

 	Since the moments of the two magnetic films are aligned at the magnetic 
saturation field Hs,  MR(H=Hs) = MR(q1 = q2) = 0, and equations (1) and (2) are 
consistent.    If the films  had  antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, then the 
moments would be antiparallel at H=0, and MR(H=0) = MR(180°) = G.        
Because these Fe/Ag/CoxFe1-x sandwiches display no antiferromagnetic 
interlayer coupling,  (q1 - q2) at H=0 is determined by magnetocrystalline 
anisotropy, as described above, and is typically  0° or 45°.     The peak in the 
magnetoresistance as a function of field therefore occurs at some H where the 
angular separation of the moments reaches a maximum, here called (q1 - q2)peak.    
As equation (2) shows, the magnetoresistance at the peak is 

			MRpeak =                .   (3)

Equation (3) implies that in order to obtain the coefficient of giant 
magnetoresistance G, we must divide the experimentally obtained MRpeak 
through by              .   As was discussed above, for four of the five 
samples  the value of (q1 - q2)peak can be directly deduced from the 
magnetization curve.   In this case,  the intrinsic, magnetic-configuration-
independent GMR coefficient  G  can be obtained directly from  Eqn. 3.    The  
deduced  magnitudes of G  and (q1 - q2)peak  are collected in Table II.   The G  
coefficient for the x = 0.3 sample is not listed because  (q1 - q2)peak  could not be 
independently determined from its magnetization curve.

	Because the hysteresis loops  of these sandwiches are dominated by 
magnetocrystalline anisotropy,  the details of the magnetization reversal process 
change as one changes the applied field orientation.      Consequently the MR 
loops and  (q1 - q2)peak also vary as the applied field direction is changed.      A 
different value of MRpeak is therefore obtained for each new applied field 
orientation.        Table II contains the MRpeak and (q1 - q2)peak values which 
correspond to the  hysteresis loops of Figs. 2 through 4.    The G  coefficient 
should be independent of the applied field orientation if the analysis based on 
Eqn. 1 is consistent.   In fact, for each of the 4 samples whose G is given in Table 
1, the magnitude of the G  determined from analysis of both the hard and easy 
axis loops is the same to within about 10%. 28   The agreement of these G  values 
can be slightly  improved by taking into account the effect of a  small unixial 
anisotropy which is often observed in samples grown on GaAs or ZnSe. 19       The 
uniaxial anisotropy causes (q1 - q2)peak to be different in loops taken along 
orthogonal <110> directions. 28     This extra analysis adds great complexity 
without changing the essential conclusions, so it is omitted here.

	Because the GMR depends on the relative orientation of the magnetic 
moments, it  is intrinsically a multilayer property.    In contrast, the well-known 
AMR is dependent on the absolute orientation of each film's moment with 
respect to the measurement current direction, and is therefore intrinsically a 
single-film property. 27            Since the different AMR contributions of the Fe and 
alloy layers cannot be  separated experimentally,  the values collected in Table II 
represent an average over   both layers.    MRpeak and the averaged AMR are 
displayed versus Co fraction in Fig. 5.    Like G  , the AMR can also be 
determined several different ways, which should of course all produce the same 
number.      Values of the AMR determined from the high-field measurements 
and from the  orientation dependence of the low-field hysteresis loops are 
consistent to within a few percent. 28 

	Freitas, Berger, and Silvain have previously measured the composition 
dependence of the AMR in both bulk and thin-film CoFe alloys. 29   In 920 Å films 
at room temperature, they  found a gradual increase in the AMR from about 0.5% 
for Fe to about 1.5% for Co.      In Fig. 5 the AMR is larger for the Fe-rich 
sandwiches than the Co-rich sandwiches, contrary to the previous findings.         
The small absolute size of the AMR for these sandwiches is attributable to both  
surface scattering and shunting by the Ag layers.    Of course, neither surface 
scattering nor shunting can explain why the slope of the AMR vs. Co 
concentration has a sign opposite to that found previously.        To explain this 
result,  one may have to consider the effects of composition-dependent epitaxial 
strain or changes in local atomic order,  both of which  could potentially have a 
large effect on the AMR. 27   More detailed studies of the magnetization and 
structure of the CoFe alloy system may clarify these issues. 16 

	The MRpeak vs. composition data in Fig. 5 are not very meaningful 
because  the sinusoidal factor                from Eqn. 3  has not been 
divided out, and the values of (q1 - q2)peak are different for each sample and each 
field orientation.       Clearly the composition dependence of the angle-
independent giant magnetoresistance coefficient G  is of greater interest.       G  is 
perhaps best understood as the GMR  that each sample would have  at the peak of 
its hysteresis curve if  the magnetic moments of its ferromagnetic layers became 
exactly antiparallel  ((q1 - q2)peak = 180°).     Only the Co/Ag/Fe sandwich truly 
had antiparallel moments at its MR peak.        Thus the giant magnetoresistance 
coefficient G. is the intrinsic composition-dependent property which should be 
amenable to theoretical calculation.     G   and Dr are plotted versus alloy 
composition in Figure 6a).     Unfortunately since (q1 - q2)peak  could not be 
determined for the x=0.3 sample, data for this sandwich are not plotted.     Note 
that in uncoupled magnetic multilayers, the problems with unknown angular 
orientation of the moments in the individual layers are  greatly compounded, 
and only the uncorrected values MRpeak can be quoted with confidence.    Even 
though the GMR of trilayer samples is small in size, trilayers offer the advantage 
that the values of (q1 - q2)peak  can usually be reliably determined from 
magnetization curves.

	The magnetic moment data in Fig. 6b) comes from the work of Bardos. 30     
A correlation between the composition dependence of the magnetic moment and 
that of the GMR would be an  indication that the degree of   conduction electron 
spin polarization was an important factor in determining the size of the GMR in a 
given ferromagnet.       A correlation of this type is expected in most simple 
theories of the GMR because the inequality of up- and down-spin resistivities is 
believed to be essential to the phenomenon. 1, 31     Clearly the spin-averaged 
resistivity and spin-flip scattering lengths  of both the ferromagnetic and 
paramagnetic layers will also play a role in determining the size of the GMR.  A 
comparison of Figs. 6a) and 6b) shows  similar trends in the GMR and magnetic 
moment data, but more experiments are needed before the issue can be settled 
definitively.     The resolution of this question remains an important objective in 
understanding the origin of the GMR.

	The field-induced change in resistivity, Dr, which is the numerator of 
equation (1), itself contains all the information about the origin of the GMR, since 
the denominator is just the zero-field resistivity.    Therefore the dependence of 
Dr on alloy composition may be more directly comparable to fundamental 
theories than the GMR itself.      The values of the field-induced change in 
resistivity in Table I were obtained by multiplying the experimental zero-field 
resistivities by G.       Examination of Table I shows that the variation of the 
relative size of Dr with composition is similar to that of the magnetoresistance 
itself.        Extensive  studies of Dr as a function of temperature and alloy-layer 
thickness could provide the information necessary to develop a quantitative 
theory of the magnitude of the GMR for different ferromagnet/paramagnet 
systems.


5. Conclusions
	
	Body-centered-cubic CoxFe1-x alloy films have now been grown 
throughout the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 1  on Ag films.    This achievement has made 
possible the growth of five Fe/Ag/CoxFe1-x sandwiches which are similar except 
for the Co content of the alloy layer.     The anisotropic magnetoresistance of 
these samples varies linearly with Co fraction, but the giant magnetoresistance 
shows a non-monotonic behavior.    The M-H loops of these samples must be 
understood in detail in order to intercompare the giant magnetoresistance data 
because of the need to correct for different magnetic configurations at the MR 
peak in different samples.      Simple sandwich structures are well-suited to  
fundamental study of GMR in systems without interlayer coupling because  the 
determination of the magnetic configuration of a uncoupled multilayer at the MR 
peak  may be quite difficult.   In further studies with variable alloy composition, 
it would be desirable to use magneto-optic characterization to clarify the 
magnetization curves of samples with complex behavior. 26     A magneto-optic 
study of the samples discussed here is already underway.

	Why the giant magnetoresistance is larger for some 
ferromagnet/paramagnet combinations than others remains is as yet an 
unanswered question.     As theorists begin to study this issue using band 
structure diagrams and density-of-states curves,  detailed information on the 
magnetoresistance of multilayers with alloy magnetic layers will become 
increasingly useful.

Table I.  Basic  properties of  the Fe/Ag/CoxFe1-x alloy sandwiches.     The layer 
thicknesses were determined using x-ray fluorescence and Auger intensity 
measurements.      The values of  K1, the four-fold magnetocrystalline anisotropy 
for the alloy layer, were determined using  ferromagnetic resonance 
measurements.   For bulk Fe, the value of K1 is 4.2 x 105 erg/cm3.   Similar values 
are seen in Fe thin films.  For the Fe/Ag/Fe film, the quoted Fe layer thickness is 
half the total measured Fe thickness.

Table II.  Transport properties of Fe/Ag/CoxFe1-x  alloy sandwiches.       Double 
entries are measurements on two different pieces of the same sandwich.    The 
differences between these nominally identical sets of numbers therefore give an 
idea of the reproducibility of the magnetoresistance measurements and the 
homogeneity of the samples.    r is the zero-field room-temperature resistivity.  
The MRpeak and (q1 - q2)peak  are data taken for the orientations shown in  
Figures 2-4 and discussed in the text.       The giant magnetoresistance coefficient 
G   is nominally orientation-independent.        The Dr numbers are obtained by 
multiplying the resistivity by G.     A ? means that the value could not be 
determined.

Figure 1.	RHEED pictures of Fe/Ag/CoxFe1-x/Ag sandwiches at  various 
stages of growth.   a)  <110>  and <100> azimuthal RHEED views of bcc Fe(001) 
grown on ZnSe.  b) <100> and <110> azimuthal RHEED views of a 
representative fcc Ag(001) spacer layer grown on bcc Fe(001).  c) <110> and 
<100> azimuthal RHEED views of  the bcc Co47Fe53(001) grown on Ag (001).   
RHEED patterns from  x = 0.71  and x = 0.30  CoxFe1-x alloy films grown on 
Ag(001)  are similar.        d) <110> and <100> azimuthal RHEED view of pure Co 
grown on Ag(001).  While the complicated RHEED pattern does not exactly 
correspond to  that of bcc Fe, the principal diffraction features are coincident.    
Ferromagnetic resonance  and magnetization measurements on the Co film show 
that it has a cubic anisotropy.

Figure 2.   a) H||(100) magnetization curve for a Fe81Å/Ag84Å/Co111Å 
sandwich.     The low-field reversal is due to the Fe film, and the high-field 
reversal is due to Co.  Ferromagnetic resonance shows no interlayer coupling.  
b) Magnetoresistance loop for the same sample in the same orientation.    The 
resistance is enhanced in the field region  Hc, Fe < |H| < Hc, Co where the 
moments of the two ferromagnetic layers are antiparallel.   The solid line 
indicates the sweep from positive to negative fields, whereas the dashed line 
indicates the sweep from negative to positive fields.

Figure 3.   a) H||(100) magnetization curve for a 
Fe76Å/Ag65Å/(Fe29Co71)84Å/Ag33Å sandwich.    This orientation is the easy 
axis for the Fe film, which reverses in  the square portion of the loop, but is the 
hard axis for the alloy film, which contributes the linear magnetization tail at 
higher fields.  b) Detail  showing low-field behavior.      Circles indicate  the field 
region where the moments are 135° apart, as sketched in the diagrams.    The 
nearly horizontal parts of the loop correspond to the two moments being 
oriented 45° apart for both directions of sweep (marked as in Fig. 2b).)   c) 
H||(100) magnetoresistance curve for the same sandwich.   The resistance is 
maximum in the field range where the angle between the Fe and alloy moments 
is 135° (as illustrated in Fig. 3b).     Dashed and solid lines are as in part b).

Figure 4.   a) H||(110) (hard axis) loop for a Fe131Å/Ag55Å/Fe124Å/Ag28Å 
sandwich.     Both Fe films have a (100) easy axis.  b) H^I||(110) 
magnetoresistance of the same sandwich.      Note the second peak in the 
magnetoresistance, which does not correlate with any discontinuity in the 
magnetization curve.   This second peak is believed to correspond to the reversal 
of a component of the magnetization which is orthogonal to the applied field, 
and thus not directly observable by the magnetometer.   Dashed and solid lines 
are as in Fig. 2.

Figure 5.    MRpeak and anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) vs. alloy 
composition.   The   AMR is approximately linear with alloy composition.    The 
dashed curve through the MR data is a guide to the eye only.

Figure 6.    a) Giant magnetoresistance coefficientG   and field-induced change in 
resistance Dr and b) magnetic moment data vs.  alloy composition.   The 
magnetic moment data is from Ref. 30.    G  is the angle-independent, intrinsic 
measure of magnetoresistance magnitude in a 
ferromagnet/paramagnet/ferromagnet sandwich.      The dashed lines in both 
these plots are guides to the eye, not fits.
