      At the chosen Ag spacer thickness of about 60, ferromagnetic
      resonance shows no measurable antiferromagnetic interlayer
      coupling between the Fe layer and the alloy layer, consistent
      with previous results on Ag-spacer systems.[20,21] The
      qualitative features of the magnetization curves are expected
      to evolve in a complex way as a function of composition since
      the four-fold magnetocrystalline anisotropy (K<sub>1</sub>)
      of bulk Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub> alloys changes from
      positive at x = 0 (pure Fe) to zero near x = 0.4 to negative
      near the bulk limit of the bcc phase at x = 0.7. 22 The
      values of K1 for the Fe/Ag/Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub>
      sandwiches are gathered in <a href="table1.html">Table I</a>.
      They are in generally good agreement with bulk values. The
      anisotropy of Co<sub>x</sub>Fe-<sub>1-x</sub> films as a
      function of composition is discussed in more detail in Ref.
      16.
    </p>
    <p>
      A VSM loop of the sample with a pure Co layer is shown in <a
      href="fig2.html">Fig. 2a).</a> Previous experience with films
      of bcc Co has shown[23] it to have a large negative four-fold
      anisotropy K<sub>1</sub> = -6.6x105 erg/cm<sup>3</sup>, so
      one anticipates that a Co film will have a &lt;11&gt; easy
      axis in the (001) plane. In fact, the Co film in the Fe/Ag/Co
      sandwich has a &lt;10&gt; easy axis and a large positive
      K<sub>1</sub>. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear.
      The Co film does have a bigger coercivity than the Fe, as
      would be expected given its much larger anisotropy.[22]
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the difference in their coercivities, the moments of
      the Fe and Co layers are antiparallel for the field range
      (Hc<sub>Fe</sub> = 0.015 kOe) &lt; |H| &lt; (Hc<sub>Co</sub>
      = 0.470 kOe). As has been shown previously,[13,24,25] the
      antiparallel orientation of the magnetic moments in different
      layers is sufficient to cause the occurrence of the giant or
      spin-valve magnetoresistance. <a href="fig2.html">Figure
      2b)</a> shows the magnetoresistance data for the same
      Fe/Ag/Co sandwich whose magnetization curve is shown in <a
      href="fig2.html">Fig 2a).</a> As expected, the resistance is
      maximum in the applied field region where |H| is less than
      the Co coercive field but greater than the Fe coercive field.
      The origin of the small shoulders in the MR near H = 0.38 kOe
      is harder to explain. These features may indicate that the Co
      film is reversing in two sequential 90&deg; steps since the
      shoulders are near the halfway point. However, the easy-axis
      magnetization reversal of a thin film with cubic anisotropy
      usually occurs by the motion of 180&deg; walls, not 90&deg;
      domain walls.[22]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fe/Ag/Co71Fe29 sandwich whose magnetization data is
      displayed in <a href="fig3.html">Figure 3a)</a> is quite
      different. Since the Co-rich alloy layer has a negative K1,
      its easy direction in the (001) plane is a &lt;11&gt; axis.
      Therefore the &lt;10&gt; magnetization curve in <a href=
      "fig3.html">Fig. 3a)</a> is an easy loop for the Fe film, but
      a hard loop for the alloy film. Knowing this we can easily
      see that the low-field square reversal with H<sub>C</sub> =
      0.04 kOe is attributable to Fe, while the higher-field linear
      magnetization characteristic corresponds to the
      Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub> layer. Because there is no
      significant interlayer magnetic coupling, the moments in each
      of the layers should each lie along their own easy axes at
      zero applied field, meaning that at H=0 there is a 45&deg;
      angle between the Fe and Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub>
      moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The low-field magnetization behavior of the same sample is
      shown in more detail in <a href="fig3.html">Fig. 3b)</a>. As
      was mentioned previously, easy axis magnetization reversal in
      cubic-anisotropy materials generally proceeds by the motion
      of 180&deg; domain walls.[22] The Fe magnetization curve
      therefore has a feature only at Hc, the coercive field. Hard
      axis reversal, on the other hand, should have the following
      steps as the applied field is decreased from a high value:
      first, reversible domain rotation of 45&deg; from the hard
      axis to the easy axis; next, after the applied field
      reverses, motion of 90&deg; domain walls or irreversible
      90&deg; rotation; lastly, reversible rotation 45&deg; from
      the reversed easy axis to the hard direction along the
      applied field. All these features are observed in the
      hard-axis reversal of the alloy film in <a href=
      "fig3.html">Fig. 3b)</a>. The moment of the alloy film jumps
      90 degrees from one (110) axis to the other at a larger
      absolute field value than that at which the Fe film's moment
      reverses by 180&deg; from one (100) direction to the other.
      Since the magnetometer measures only the component of the
      moment along the applied field, the 90&deg; jump is
      positively identifiable as the smaller of the two low-field
      discontinuities of the moment in <a href="fig3.html">Fig.
      3b)</a>. <a href="fig3.html">Fig. 3c)</a> shows that, as
      expected, there is a magnetization peak in the field region
      where there is a maximum angle of 135&deg; between the
      alloy-film moment and the Fe film moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As <a href="fig4.html">Figure 4</a> shows, data for the
      Fe/Ag/Fe sandwich (x = 0) is surprising. There is only one
      ferromagnetic resonance line for this sandwich, in contrast
      to the two resonances observed when x&shy; 0, so that the
      magnetocrystalline anisotropies of the two films appear to be
      identical. Previous work has shown that K1 in Fe films on
      ZnSe and Ag is not very sensitive to disorder, but that the
      coercive field Hc may be affected.[19] Broader RHEED streaks
      from the top Fe film indicate it has more defects than the
      lower Fe film, so a different coercivity for this film seems
      reasonable. From the general considerations described above,
      one can then attribute the lower-field peak in the
      magnetoresistance in <a href="fig4.html">Fig. 4b)</a> to the
      film's moment irreversibly rotating 90&deg; before the other
      film's. We therefore expect the angular separation of the Fe
      moments at the MR peak to be 90 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly the higher-field magnetoresistance "2nd peak" in <a
      href="fig4.html">Fig. 4b)</a> cannot be so easily explained.
      In order to understand the origin of the second peak, which
      does not correspond to any discernible feature in <a href=
      "fig4.html">Fig. 4a)</a>, it is necessary to recall that the
      vibrating sample magnetometer only measures the component of
      the magnetization along the applied field. Thus the reversal
      of a component of the magnetization which is orthogonal to
      the applied field will not show up in a VSM loop. Florczak
      and Dahlberg have suggested that in thin (001) Fe films a
      small misalignment of the applied field from the hard
      &lt;11&gt; axis causes the magnetization reversal to occur as
      two 90&deg; irreversible rotations.[26] The reason is that
      the moment then has two hard-axis energy barriers to surmount
      in order to complete a reversal. The second of the two
      transitions is unobservable in a VSM experiment because the
      component of magnetization perpendicular to the applied field
      reverses.[26] In keeping with this hypothesis, the
      higher-field magnetoresistance peak of <a href=
      "fig4.html">Fig. 4b)</a> may well coincide with a second
      90&deg; irreversible rotation by one of the Fe moments. The
      field at which the second MR jump occurs is in good agreement
      with the field at which Florczak and Dahlberg observed the
      reversal of the perpendicular component of the Fe
      magnetization using the Kerr effect.[26] In this picture, the
      higher-field MR peak is smaller than the lower-field peak
      because both moments have already rotated further toward the
      hard axis at the field where the second jump occurs. This
      leads to an angular separation of the moments less than
      90&deg; at the second peak, and thus a smaller resistance
      change.
