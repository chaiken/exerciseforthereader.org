    <p>
      The field dependence of the magnetoresistance has been
      obtained from the raw data using the definition
    </p>
    <p>
      (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      As has been detailed before,[13,25] the angular dependence of
      the giant magnetoresistance is described by
    </p>
    <p>
      (2)
    </p>
    <p>
      where (theta<sub>1</sub> - theta<sub>2</sub>) is the relative
      orientation of the moments of the two magnetic films and G is
      the coefficient of giant magnetoresistance. The term that
      describes the angular dependence of the anisotropic
      magnetoresistance (AMR) has been omitted from equation (2).
      The AMR is the magnetoresistance that is characteristic of
      the individual films.[27] The magnitude of the AMR can be
      separately determined at high field where the GMR term
      doesn't contribute because (theta<sub>1</sub> -
      theta<sub>2</sub>) = 0.[25] The maximum MR for each sample
      minus the AMR contribution is listed in <a href=
      "table2.html">Table II</a> as MR<sub>peak</sub>. The AMR is
      also listed in <a href="table2.html">Table II</a> for each
      sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the moments of the two magnetic films are aligned at
      the magnetic saturation field H<sub>s</sub>,
      MR(H=H<sub>s</sub>) = MR(theta<sub>1</sub> =
      theta<sub>2</sub>) = 0, and equations (1) and (2) are
      consistent. If the films had antiferromagnetic interlayer
      coupling, then the moments would be antiparallel at H=0, and
      MR(H=0) = MR(180&deg;) = G. Because these
      Fe/Ag/Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub> sandwiches display no
      antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, (theta<sub>1</sub> -
      theta<sub>2</sub>) at H=0 is determined by magnetocrystalline
      anisotropy, as described above, and is typically 0&deg; or
      45&deg;. The peak in the magnetoresistance as a function of
      field therefore occurs at some H where the angular separation
      of the moments reaches a maximum, here called
      (theta<sub>1</sub> - theta<sub>2</sub>)<sub>peak</sub>. As
      equation (2) shows, the magnetoresistance at the peak is
    </p>
    <p>
      MR<sub>peak</sub> = (3)
    </p>
    <p>
      Equation (3) implies that in order to obtain the coefficient
      of giant magnetoresistance G, we must divide the
      experimentally obtained MR<sub>peak</sub> through by . As was
      discussed above, for four of the five samples the value of
      (theta<sub>1</sub> - theta<sub>2</sub>)<sub>peak</sub> can be
      directly deduced from the magnetization curve. In this case,
      the intrinsic, magnetic-configuration- independent GMR
      coefficient G can be obtained directly from Eqn. 3. The
      deduced magnitudes of G and (theta<sub>1</sub> -
      theta<sub>2</sub>)<sub>peak</sub> are collected in <a href=
      "table2.html">Table II</a>. The G coefficient for the x = 0.3
      sample is not listed because (theta<sub>1</sub> -
      theta<sub>2</sub>)<sub>peak</sub> could not be independently
      determined from its magnetization curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the hysteresis loops of these sandwiches are
      dominated by magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the details of
      the magnetization reversal process change as one changes the
      applied field orientation. Consequently the MR loops and
      (theta<sub>1</sub> - theta<sub>2</sub>)<sub>peak</sub> also
      vary as the applied field direction is changed. A different
      value of MR<sub>peak</sub> is therefore obtained for each new
      applied field orientation. <a href="table2.html">Table II</a>
      contains the MR<sub>peak</sub> and (theta<sub>1</sub> -
      theta<sub>2</sub>)<sub>peak</sub> values which correspond to
      the hysteresis loops of Figs. 2 through 4. The G coefficient
      should be independent of the applied field orientation if the
      analysis based on Eqn. 1 is consistent. In fact, for each of
      the 4 samples whose G is given in <a href="table1.html">Table
      1</a>, the magnitude of the G determined from analysis of
      both the hard and easy axis loops is the same to within about
      10%.[28] The agreement of these G values can be slightly
      improved by taking into account the effect of a small unixial
      anisotropy which is often observed in samples grown on GaAs
      or ZnSe.[19] The uniaxial anisotropy causes
      (theta<sub>1</sub> - theta<sub>2</sub>)<sub>peak</sub> to be
      different in loops taken along orthogonal &lt;11&gt;
      directions.[28] This extra analysis adds great complexity
      without changing the essential conclusions, so it is omitted
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the GMR depends on the relative orientation of the
      magnetic moments, it is intrinsically a multilayer property.
      In contrast, the well-known AMR is dependent on the absolute
      orientation of each film's moment with respect to the
      measurement current direction, and is therefore intrinsically
      a single-film property.[27] Since the different AMR
      contributions of the Fe and alloy layers cannot be separated
      experimentally, the values collected in <a href=
      "table2.html">Table II</a> represent an average over both
      layers. MR<sub>peak</sub> and the averaged AMR are displayed
      versus Co fraction in <a href="fig5.html">Fig. 5</a>. Like G
      , the AMR can also be determined several different ways,
      which should of course all produce the same number. Values of
      the AMR determined from the high-field measurements and from
      the orientation dependence of the low-field hysteresis loops
      are consistent to within a few percent.[28]
    </p>
    <p>
      Freitas, Berger, and Silvain have previously measured the
      composition dependence of the AMR in both bulk and thin-film
      CoFe alloys.[29] In 920&Aring; films at room temperature,
      they found a gradual increase in the AMR from about 0.5% for
      Fe to about 1.5% for Co. In <a href="fig5.html">Fig. 5</a>
      the AMR is larger for the Fe-rich sandwiches than the Co-rich
      sandwiches, contrary to the previous findings. The small
      absolute size of the AMR for these sandwiches is attributable
      to both surface scattering and shunting by the Ag layers. Of
      course, neither surface scattering nor shunting can explain
      why the slope of the AMR vs. Co concentration has a sign
      opposite to that found previously. To explain this result,
      one may have to consider the effects of composition-dependent
      epitaxial strain or changes in local atomic order, both of
      which could potentially have a large effect on the AMR.[27]
      More detailed studies of the magnetization and structure of
      the CoFe alloy system may clarify these issues.[16]
    </p>
    <p>
      The MR<sub>peak</sub> vs. composition data in <a href=
      "fig5.html">Fig. 5</a> are not very meaningful because the
      sinusoidal factor from Eqn. 3 has not been divided out, and
      the values of (theta<sub>1</sub> -
      theta<sub>2</sub>)<sub>peak</sub> are different for each
      sample and each field orientation. Clearly the composition
      dependence of the angle- independent giant magnetoresistance
      coefficient G is of greater interest. G is perhaps best
      understood as the GMR that each sample would have at the peak
      of its hysteresis curve if the magnetic moments of its
      ferromagnetic layers became exactly antiparallel
      ((theta<sub>1</sub> - theta<sub>2</sub>)<sub>peak</sub> =
      180&deg;). Only the Co/Ag/Fe sandwich truly had antiparallel
      moments at its MR peak. Thus the giant magnetoresistance
      coefficient G is the intrinsic composition-dependent property
      which should be amenable to theoretical calculation. G and Dr
      are plotted versus alloy composition in <a href=
      "fig6.html">Figure 6a)</a>. Unfortunately since
      (theta<sub>1</sub> - theta<sub>2</sub>)<sub>peak</sub> could
      not be determined for the x=0.3 sample, data for this
      sandwich are not plotted. Note that in uncoupled magnetic
      multilayers, the problems with unknown angular orientation of
      the moments in the individual layers are greatly compounded,
      and only the uncorrected values MR<sub>peak</sub> can be
      quoted with confidence. Even though the GMR of trilayer
      samples is small in size, trilayers offer the advantage that
      the values of (theta<sub>1</sub> -
      theta<sub>2</sub>)<sub>peak</sub> can usually be reliably
      determined from magnetization curves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnetic moment data in <a href="fig6.html">Fig. 6b)</a>
      comes from the work of Bardos.[30] A correlation between the
      composition dependence of the magnetic moment and that of the
      GMR would be an indication that the degree of conduction
      electron spin polarization was an important factor in
      determining the size of the GMR in a given ferromagnet. A
      correlation of this type is expected in most simple theories
      of the GMR because the inequality of up- and down-spin
      resistivities is believed to be essential to the phenomenon.
      1, 31 Clearly the spin-averaged resistivity and spin-flip
      scattering lengths of both the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic
      layers will also play a role in determining the size of the
      GMR. A comparison of <a href="fig6.html">Figs. 6a) and
      6b)</a> shows similar trends in the GMR and magnetic moment
      data, but more experiments are needed before the issue can be
      settled definitively. The resolution of this question remains
      an important objective in understanding the origin of the
      GMR.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field-induced change in resistivity, Dr, which is the
      numerator of equation (1), itself contains all the
      information about the origin of the GMR, since the
      denominator is just the zero-field resistivity. Therefore the
      dependence of Dr on alloy composition may be more directly
      comparable to fundamental theories than the GMR itself. The
      values of the field-induced change in resistivity in <a href=
      "table1.html">Table I</a> were obtained by multiplying the
      experimental zero-field resistivities by G. Examination of <a
      href="table1.html">Table I</a> shows that the variation of
      the relative size of Dr with composition is similar to that
      of the magnetoresistance itself. Extensive studies of Dr as a
      function of temperature and alloy-layer thickness could
      provide the information necessary to develop a quantitative
      theory of the magnitude of the GMR for different
      ferromagnet/paramagnet systems.
