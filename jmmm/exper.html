      The sandwiches used in this study were grown by molecular
      beam epitaxy using elemental sources. First, a ZnSe buffer
      layer a few thousand angstroms thick was deposited on a
      semi-insulating (100) GaAs substrate. Then the sandwich
      layers of Fe, Ag, and CoFe alloy were sequentially deposited
      on the ZnSe layer, in each case maintaining good epitaxial
      registry with the substrate. Finally a thin Ag or Al cap
      layer was deposited on each sample to prevent oxidation. The
      first Fe layer was always grown with a slightly elevated
      substrate temperature of 175C in order to optimize
      crystalline perfection,[17] but subsequent layers were grown
      with the substrate cooled to -10 to -20&deg;C to minimize
      interdiffusion. Auger electron spectroscopy at each stage of
      growth showed that C and O contamination was less than 1%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) camera
      photographs of the surface at various stages of the growth
      are shown in Fig. 1. The photographs show that the first Fe
      layer goes down in the (001) orientation, as has been
      demonstrated previously.[17] The Ag and
      Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub> layers also go down in the
      (001) orientation, with the alloy layer in the bcc phase for
      all compositions despite the fact that at room temperature
      bulk Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub> is mixed-phase for Co
      fractions greater than x = 0.75.[18] The RHEED pattern for
      the pure Co film suggest that the surface is rough, and that
      there are crystalline defects. However, the symmetry of this
      film is clearly cubic, as demonstrated both by the RHEED
      pattern and by angle-dependent ferromagnetic resonance
      measurements which are described further below. A total of
      five Fe/Ag/Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub> sandwiches were
      grown with alloy compositions ranging from pure Fe (x = 0) to
      pure Co (x = 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Flux rates during growth were monitored using a calibrated
      UTI 100C quadropole mass analyzer. The total thickness of the
      deposited metal was measured by x-ray fluorescence (XRF)
      spectroscopy. The nominal thicknesses of the corresponding
      layers were kept constant from sample to sample at (Fe
      80&Aring;/Ag 60&Aring;/Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub>
      80&Aring;/Ag 20&Aring;). Actual layer thicknesses and alloy
      compositions were calculated by combining XRF and integrated
      Auger intensities measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using well-established analysis methods,[19] the angular
      dependence of the 35 GHz ferromagnetic resonance field was
      used to determine the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of each
      magnetic layer in each sample. Measured layer thicknesses and
      anisotropies are given in Table I. Results for the plain Fe
      films were similar to those previously observed for Fe on
      ZnSe.[19] Magnetic hysteresis loops were taken using a
      vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM). Magnetoresistance
      measurements were made using Ag paint or pressed In contacts
      placed at the two ends of 2mm by 1cm strips cleaved off the
      original 1 cm by 1 cm wafer. Several samples were measured
      with both types of contacts, and no difference was observed.
      The measurement current was always along the GaAs [110]
      direction and the applied field always in-plane. All
      measurements were performed at room temperature. The
      sandwiches had resistivities in the range 15 &plusmn; 5
      microOhm-cm with no systematic trend versus alloy
      composition.
