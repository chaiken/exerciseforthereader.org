      The hysteresis loop and MOIF images of domain structure
      observed during the magnetization reversal of the NiO/NiFe
      bilayer grown on the (001) MgO substrate are shown in <a
      href="fig1.html">Fig. 1.</a> The magnetic field was applied
      along the [110] direction or along reversed one. The [110]
      direction coincides with the direction of a magnetic field
      applied during the bilayer growth. Letters on the hysteresis
      loop refer to the conditions of the corresponding MOIF
      patterns. The hysteresis loop exhibits an exchange shift
      (H<sub>E</sub> = 35 Oe) and substantial coercivity
      (H<sub>C</sub> = 40 Oe). The MOIF patterns display that the
      magnetization reversal of the bilayer proceeds by nucleation
      and subsequent growth of domains with new magnetization
      orientations. Moreover, an asymmetry is revealed in the
      activity of the domain nucleation centers. When the magnetic
      field is aligned along the unidirectional anisotropy axis,
      the nucleation of domains occurs in central regions of the
      field of view at some defects <a href="fig1.html">(Fig.
      1b)</a>. However, when the field is aligned in the opposite
      direction, the domain nucleation starts at other centers <a
      href="fig1.html">(Fig. 1f).</a> Moreover, the reversal is
      finished at the former nucleation centers <a href=
      "fig1.html">(Fig. 1h).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast to the above picture, no asymmetry in the
      reversal of NiFe grown on MgO without NiO buffer is observed.
      Domains nucleate and disappear at film edges for both field
      directions parallel to the easy axis. The magnetization
      reversal proceeds by means of motion of almost rectilinear
      domain walls with cross ties over the whole sample <a href=
      "fig2.html">(Fig. 2a, b).</a> There is also no shift in the
      hysteresis loop of this free NiFe layer, and its coercive
      force is very small (approximately 2 Oe). For comparison,
      examples of domain structures created during magnetization
      reversal of the deformed section of the same NiO/NiFe bilayer
      as described in <a href="fig1.html">Fig. 1</a> are shown in
      <a href="fig2.html">Figs. 2c and 2d.</a> Dislocation slip
      planes are shown in <a href="fig2.html">Figs. 2e and 2f.</a>
      <a href="fig2.html">Fig. 2e</a> shows NiFe surface steps
      revealed in reflected light on the NiFe/NiO bilayer. <a href=
      "fig2.html">Fig. 2f</a> shows microstresses from edge
      dislocations as revealed by a photoelasticity method.[9] Both
      the edge and screw dislocations were introduced into the MgO
      substrate during cleaving before the bilayer deposition. The
      same dislocation structure was found in the unbiased NiFe
      film described above. Note the weak influence of dislocations
      on the reversal of the unbiased NiFe film in <a href=
      "fig2.html">Figs. 2a and 2b.</a> This is due to the small
      permalloy magnetostriction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast, the magnetization reversal in the deformed
      NiO/NiFe bilayer depends essentially on the dislocation
      structure. The dislocations not only impede domain wall
      motion, but also play the role of domain nucleation centers.
      As a result, the specific head-to-head domain walls are
      disposed, as a rule, along the dislocation slip planes <a
      href="fig2.html">(Fig. 2c).</a> Moreover, anisotropy
      inhomogeneities caused by dislocation stresses affect
      strongly the magnetization rotation processes at the
      saturation stage of the reversal (<a href="fig2.html">Fig.
      2d</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      A very important conclusion can be made from the analysis of
      the above data. Dislocations in the NiO/NiFe bilayer
      influence primarily the spin configuration of the AF layer.
      The spin behavior in the FM layer is affected only through
      its interaction with the AF layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Domain structures observed during the [1-10] hard-axis
      magnetization reversal of the plastically deformed NiO/NiFe
      bilayer are shown in <a href="fig3.html">Fig. 3.</a> The
      hysteresis loop (<a href="fig3.html">Fig. 3a</a>) has a
      symmetric shape and demonstrates a very small coercivity. In
      this case the magnetization reversal proceeds primarily by
      the incoherent rotation of magnetization vectors. However,
      unexpected nucleation and growth of domains has also been
      revealed. Both of these processes proceed simultaneously and
      are strongly governed by the dislocation structure. Elongated
      domains arise along screw dislocation slip planes, the most
      remarkable inhomogeneities of the spin rotation are observed
      along the slip planes of edge dislocations.
    </p>
    <p>
      For comparison, <a href="fig4.html">Fig. 4</a> shows typical
      domain structures for a polycrystalline NiO/NiFe bilayer (a)
      and for a polycrystalline free NiFe film (b) grown on Si. The
      magnetic field was applied along the [110] unidirectional and
      along the [110] easy axis, respectively. Similar to the above
      results, imperfections in the NiO crucially affect the domain
      structure of the bilayer. As a result, the bilayer displays a
      complicated fine-scaled domain structure (<a href=
      "fig4.html">Fig. 4a</a>). In the polycrystalline NiFe film
      grown on Si without NiO buffer, the domain structure is
      simpler and the remagnetization proceeds by the motion of
      almost rectilinear domain walls with cross ties over large
      distances (<a href="fig4.html">Fig. 4b</a>).
