      Abstract:
    </h3>
    <p>
      A novel design is presented for a cryogenically cooled
      multi-substrate sample holder for thin film deposition in
      high vacuum. The cryogen flows through tubing soldered onto a
      fixed copper plate, while the substrates are mounted on a
      separate tray which is supported by a linear/rotary-motion
      feedthrough. By lowering the substrate tray into firm contact
      with the copper plate, we can achieve substrate temperatures
      as low as 120 K.
    </p>
    <p>
      A common difficulty in the mechanical design of high vacuum
      systems is reconciling rotary or linear motion of a sample
      with simultaneous heating or cooling. While there are
      commercially available solutions to this problem for a single
      substrate, the difficulty is compounded when the user wants
      to manipulate multiple heated or cooled samples without
      breaking vacuum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Substrate cooling is necessary in order achieve sharp
      compositional gradients in multilayer films composed of
      reactive materials. For example, multilayer films composed of
      Fe and Ge which were deposited onto nominal room temperature
      substrates were found to be non-magnetic and poorly
      layered.[1] On the other hand, the deposition of several
      multilayers without breaking vacuum is highly desirable for
      reasons of reproducibility. In our design, the sample holder
      has been split into two parts in order to accommodate both
      substrate cooling and the interchange of multiple substrates:
      a stationary tray to which cooling lines are brazed, and a
      moving tray on which the multiple substrates are mounted. In
      order to cool a substrate, the moving tray is pressed firmly
      against the stationary tray, and liquid nitrogen is allowed
      to flow through the cooling lines. When the deposition is
      finished, the user can change substrates by raising the
      moving tray and then rotating to the new substrate position.
      The moving tray is then lowered with the new substrate in
      place over the aperture in the stationary tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      A schematic drawing of the system is shown in Figure 1. The
      stationary tray is supported by aluminum rods (not shown). In
      order to provide maximum thermal isolation for the two trays,
      the support rods are insulated from the stationary tray by
      ceramic washers and the moving tray is connected to the
      universal joint via a teflon rod. On the underside of the
      stationary tray, a thermocouple attached to a ceramic post
      presses against the moving tray through a hole in the
      stationary tray. This thermocouple provides an approximate
      measurement of the substrate temperature. Another
      thermocouple (not shown) is mounted on the stationary tray
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experience has shown that the stationary tray reaches a
      temperature of 100K after running liquid nitrogen for 35
      minutes, while the moving tray reaches a final temperature of
      120K after 45 minutes. This cooling is adequate to allow
      deposition of Fe/Ge multilayers with good magnetic and
      structural properties.[1]

       <strong>Figure 1:</strong> Schematic drawing of the
      cryogenically cooled multiple substrate holder. The major
      components are: 1) the linear/rotary motion feedthrough; 2)
      the universal joint which allow rotary motion around
      orthogonal axes, making thermal contact of the plates
      insensitive to their relative alignment; 3) the moving
      substrate tray; 4) the stationary cryogenically cooled tray;
      5) the aperture in the stationary tray through which
      deposition occurs; and 6) the cryogen lines. Both the motion
      and cryogen feedthroughs are mounted on 2 3/4" copper-gasket
      flanges. The material is OFHC copper for the trays and the
      cooling lines. The universal joints and support rods
      connecting them are made of aluminum except for one support
      rod which is made of teflon in order to maximize thermal
      isolation.
