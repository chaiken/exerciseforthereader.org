    <p>
      The following method works for me:
    </p>
    <p>
      1) Cut the top off the pineapple and remove all of the fruit.
      If you leave some fruit on it will rot the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) Remove the bottom 1" or 1 and 1/2" of leaves The stalk
      will root but the leaves will rot.
    </p>
    <p>
      3) (the secret) Dry the top for two days or until a callous
      forms Depending on the humidity this could be as short as a
      day or as long asa week. Do this some place cool and dry. If
      you don't do this the stalk will rot.
    </p>
    <p>
      4) Dip the stalk end in water and then into rooting hormone.
      This makes rooting faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      5) Lay the stalk in a pot of fast draining potting soil so
      that only part of the stalk is touching the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't put the entire stalk in the soil. In other words DO NOT
      plat the stalk in a vertical position. If you do then it is
      highly likely the stalk will rot. If you live in a very dry
      climate (e.g., Arizona or new mexico) then put the pot and
      stalk in a plastic bag (e.g., dry cleaning bag) to conserve
      moisture.
    </p>
    <p>
      6) Mist frequently to keep the soil moist but not wet. Roots
      should appear in 2 or 3 weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      7) Once roots appear, repot the pineapple (this time in the
      vertical position) in a fast draining pooting soil (e.g.,
      half pooting soil half perlite).
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, pineapples are actually bromeliads. Hence they like
      tropical conditions. High light, constant humidity, and
      constant lite fertilizer in the summer time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2 or 3 years, it will grow another pineapple.

      I feel full sun is very important for a happy pineapple. In
      three years my plant has seen it all; cold weather, frost,
      low light and dry conditions. I would suggest full sun if
      possible. Considering that the humidity rarely dips below 30%
      here, low light seems to bother the plant more than low
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shot of Miracle Grow Patio helps. When the pineapple
      started to appear I started using bloom booster.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, it is getting ripe. It is beginning to swell and
      turn light green or gold around the flower sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      After 3 failures (death by frost) it's good to see one
      produce. Maybe I found one with enough will to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      My pineapple looked like it was about ready to give up the
      ghost before it produced. I have heard, like banana trees,
      they have to produce a certain number of leaves before they
      will bare. I counted 44 leaves on mine and may have missed a
      few. How many leaves does your have?
    </p>
    <p>
      I had mine in a 10 gal pot and it was rootbound when I
      transplanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a thought... Putting it in a black pot may result in
      warmer roots. That may be why it's happier in the winter.

      Just a word to let you know recent developments. The
      pineapple ripened and was delicious! Not only was It sweeter
      and juicer than the ones from our supermarket but its aroma
      filled the house.
