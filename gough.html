<pre>
A stranger came from far away
To spend his Christmas by the Bay.
This clever lad was feeling tough,
Until he tried to locate Gough.

His tired arms were weighted down
With Christmas gifts he'd bought in town,
This season when the holly bough
Was decking all the halls on Gough.

His girl, you see, for whom he pined,
Lived on that street he could not find.
He searched The City through and through,
Till he was bushed, and still, no Gough.

He stopped a native on Van Ness
And told his tale of great distress.
"I'm lost," he cried, "I've spent my dough,
And now I have to get to Gough. . .

"To see my girl, Octavia,
Who's on leave from the Navy."
"Uh," The San Franciscan made a cough.
"I'd like to help you get to Gough. . .

"But first you have to learn to say
That street name in the proper way."
"The proper way!" the stranger huffed.
"I say it like it's spelled. It's Gough."

The native laughed. The stranger cried,
"It isn't fair. I've tried and tried.
And all you do is laugh and scoff,
And won't show me the way to Gough."

"At last! That's it!" the native yelped.
"I'm glad this little lesson helped.
Now, walk two blocks, that's quite enough.
It's all up hill, but there's your Gough."

"Thanks much," the lad said, "and I doff
My hat to you. I'm off to Gough.
Just one more question, and then home.
Now, where the devil is Sansome?"
