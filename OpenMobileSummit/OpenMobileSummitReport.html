<h1><a href="http://www.openmobilesummit.com/">"Open Mobile Summit"</a></h1>
<h2>San Francisco, November 19-20, 2008</h2>

</p>

<p><b>Takeaways for our team:</b> Widespread WiMax deployment would be
  a tremendous enabler for the Internet of Things, as it is expected
  to cheaper, faster, more available and more open than any of the
  alternatives.  Telcos are clearly unenthusiastic about WiMax, but
  given Intel's advocacy and clout, they may not be able to squelch
  it.  Another
  <a href="Mobility_2009_Preview_451Group_Dec-12-08.pdf">recent
  analyst report</a> suggests that SDR radio products (or perhaps even
  Qualcomm's new offerings) may lead to handsets that support both LTE
  and WiMax, reducing the need for a large initial investment in this
  time of poor capital availability.  Jasper Wireless with its resale
  of small chunks of connectivity in the machine-to-machine space is
  another business who services enable more devices to be connected
  affordably and ubiquitously.
</p>

<p>Amazon gives the impression that its strategy includes plans for
  further devices based on the claimed popularity of the Kindle.  The
  analogy with Apple and its leveraging iPod/iTunes into wider success
  may be relevant.  Given the negative remarks Amazon's representative
  made about color eInk, I wonder if they are talking to OLED
  companies or
  even <a href="http://www.plasticlogic.com/product.html">Plastic
  Logic.</a>
</p>

<p><b>Trends:</b>Apparently ever single company present at the Conference has an
  SDK.  The joke used to be that there were more Linux distros than
  users.  Now there appear to be more SDKs than developers.
</p>

<p>A lot of companies are planning to follow Apple's lead into the
  more specialized device market.  Besides Amazon, Motorola is clearly
  tipping its hand and others will undoubtedly follow.  In 10 years,
  Amazon or even eBay (which still owns PayPal and Skype) may well be
  Google's biggest competitor.
</p>

<p><b>Prefatory comments:</b> Notable no-shows were Apple and
  Microsoft, neither of which makes any pretense of being "open."
  Apple was much discussed by participants, but Microsoft was
  mentioned only by Yahoo, who seemed to be publicly wishing for MS to
  rescue them, and Google, who practically cursed MS in
  an <a href="#orange">anecdote about Orange</a>.  In what follows I
  have used the terms "telcos," "network operators" and "carriers"
  interchangeably, if only because the speakers did.
</p>


<h3>Session 1: Building the open mobile economy</h3>

<p><b>Rich Wong, Accel Ventures:</b> 55% of the world's population now
  has a mobile handset, reflecting a growth in usage from 1 billion to
  4 billion units from 2000 to 2008.  Major trends include software
  fragmentation, direct sales to consumers rather than network
  operators, and cheaper smartphones making sophisticated applications
  widely available.  The mobile space will continue to grow during the
  upcoming downturn just as Google, Amazon and EBay grew during the
  dot-com crash.  It's work noting that at the time of the NASDAQ
  peak, Altavista was the most popular search engine!  Mobile
  advertising will grow 10-15% in 2009 as it continues to take market
  share from print.  Wong comments that the country of Singapore is
  the ultimate "walled garden," and contrasts the froth that is India.
  He compares the iPhone to Singapore and the Android platform to
  India!  The small penetration of smartphones isn't really an issue
  if their owners access the web frequently enough.
</p>

<p><b>Eric Klein, Sun:</b> Talked about release of JavaFX, Sun's new
  "rich media platform" for mobile, which is "aimed at designers
  rather than developers."  Sun's Java revenue comes almost entirely
  from handset manufacturers licensing Sun's products.  Smartphone
  sales are right now only 15M units per year compared to more like a
  billion total handsets deployed.
</p>

<p><b>Len Lauer, Qualcomm:</b> Phones in the future will not get
  faster, but more valuable. Qualcomm is targeting netbooks as a
  growth area and has produced a special chipset for them, the Gobi,
  which features multiple radios plus integrated GPS.  The similar
  Snapdragon will feature multiple radios plus GPS and be aimed at
  mobile handsets.  All products, including PCs, will have multiple
  modems and GPS.  Netbooks will be connected all the time when they
  are powered on.  NFC and micropayments in the U.S. are 3-4 years
  away.  Qualcomm's
  multiplatform <a href="http://www.firethornmobile.com/">Firethorn
  project</a> is their foray into the micropayment space, and they
  have already signed up some banks and network operators as
  development partners.  Giant retailers like McDonalds will be first.
  Web companies are already taking business away from network
  operators.  The winner in the space will be the company that figures
  out how to create one contact list for all applications.
</p>

<p><b>Rebecca Hanson, XOHM initiative, Sprint Nextel:</b> XOHM is
  Sprint's rather desperate attempt to roll out a WiMax network in the
  U.S.  Network operators appear to be more committed
  to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3GPP_Long_Term_Evolution">LTE</a>.
  XOHM's trial roll-out in Baltimore already has demonstrated 2-4 Mb/s
  download and 1-1.5 Mb/s upload.  Partners for the trial include
  Comcast, Intel, Google and Time-Warner.  Participating consumers get
  Lenovo, Acer, Asus or Toshiba netbooks with embedded WiMax
  capability.  Sprint advocates the sale of unsubsidized WiMax phones
  without contracts in regular stores.  30 chipsets for WiMax exist,
  and a long list of manufacturers (Intel, Nokia, Toshiba, Motorola,
  Lenovo, Samsung, Dell, Acer, LG, etc.)  participates at some level.
  XOHM applications do not require signing: the platform is truly
  open.  The new business model for consumer electronics is that
  manufacturers of WiMax-enabled devices like cameras will sell upload
  connectivity to users for an ongoing fee.  Korea already has widely
  deployed WiMax.  Telcos in Brazil, Russia and India are deploying
  large WiMax pilots.  [Since the conference, Clearwire, which has
  purchased XOHM, has announced
  a <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/12/15/portland-gets-wimax-service/">large
  WiMax deployment in Portland OR</a>.]
</p>

<p><b>Marco Boerries, Yahoo:</b> Yahoo will offer a new mobile
  advertising platform called Blueprint with ad agencies in partners
  starting in January 2009.  A voice-driven mobile search service
  using a technology called "Bling" will be rolled out in March 2009.
  Yahoo is promising to roll-out a special "killer app" for creating
  mobile banner ads.  I asked during the Q&#38;A if it wouldn't be
  possible to just automatically rescale existing banners intended for
  large displays.  Boerries said no, but undoubtedly he hasn't seen
  the
  remarkable <a href="http://bremblebeck.wordpress.com/2007/08/21/seam-carving-2/">seam-carving
  algorithm</a> for automated image reduction.  Boerries says that the
  apps at the Android store stink, as the store was rushed out before
  it was truly ready.
</p>

<p>During the break between sessions, Daphne Won of Nokia Research
  asked me if it were true that "Steve Manzer is leading an HP
  initiative to create an HP-branded Android handset."
</p>


<h3>Session 2: Builing the open mobile economy</h3>

<p><b>Mike Grant, Analysys Mason:</b> The leader in mobile broadband
  penetration is, surprisingly, Austria, where 3G is cheaper than DSL.
  A similar situation exists in Poland and Finland.  A significant
  fraction of users employ 3G as their sole means of internet access
  as well as their sole means of voice communication.   2008 saw text
  messages outnumber voice calls for the first time in the U.S.   In
  the June-September 2008 quarter, 13% of all handsets shipped were
  smartphones, with Symbian continuing to lead iPhone 2:1 in unit
  sales.   The iPhone in fact is just ahead of RIM units in number
  sold.   Apple's big advantage is the similarity of the U.I. across
  its whole family of products.   Nokia is attempting a similar unity
  of experience with its Ovi platform and LifeTools initiative.
</p>

<h3>Session 3: Open networks and challengers</h3>

<p><b>Disruptive Voice:</b>A panel discussion featured speakers from
  Rebtel, Truphone and Skype.  The first two companies offer methods
  to use VOIP from a 3G handset via a downloadable client.  Truphone's
  client can be downloaded from the Apple Store despite Apple's
  relationship with AT&amp;T.  Rebtel is mostly a middleman, selling
  VOIP connectivity in emerging markets to established western network
  operators.
</p>

<p><b>Robert Syputa, Maravedis:</b>In 2009, only tablets and PCMCIA
  cards will support WiMax, not handsets.    WiMax and LTE are 90% the
  same, both being based on software-defined radio.      WiMax is
  trying to take customers from DSL and cable as well as 3G.   The
  idea that WiMax needs a big rollout is wrong, as handsets already
  have multiple radios, and customers don't know or care about the
  differences between networks.
</p>

<p><b>Scott
  Barkley, <a href="http://www.jasperwireless.com/for-technology-partners.html">Jasper
  Wireless</a>:</b> Jasper is in the machine-to-machine communication
  business, providing connectivity in a software-as-a-service model to
  60 million installed devices.  These include power meters,
  point-of-sale terminals, Kindle and OnStar.  New applications
  including tollbooths, moving walkways and billboards.  Jasper helps
  embedded and mobile device OEMs include 3G connectivity in a wide
  variety of products.  They define their business as "single-digit
  ARPU (average revenue per unit)" while the telcos are in the
  multi-digit business.  Jasper resells telco connectivity to the
  smaller businesses.  Jasper's business model is all about minimizing
  installation and support costs.  Why would walkways and billboards
  use 3G instead of WiFi?  Because companies that sell these "managed"
  hardware products offer maintenance services under a subscription
  model without ever visiting the customer's site.  Customers can set
  up the product without doing any communications configuration
  whatsoever if the product includes a 3G modem.  OnStar has an
  installed base of greater than 5 million units, with over 1 million
  smart power meters installed in Sweden.
</p>

<p><b>Ian Freed, Amazon:</b> The Kindle has major advantages of the
  paper book: portable, easy to read, comfortable to hold, readable in
  sunlight and instant-on.  Kindle also has improvements over the
  book: 60 second delivery of books over EVDO, 200-book capacity,
  built-in dictionary, search facility and Wikipedia and periodical
  access. An important aspect of the Kindle experience is that the
  user purchases a book, not a download, as the wireless connection is
  free with the purchase; there are no connect charges.  Kindle is a
  reading product, not an internet appliance!  The Kindle was
  celebrating its 1-year birthday on November 19, and it now
  represents greater than 10% of Amazon's book sales.  Kindles don't
  come preloaded with books, but purchasers believe that they do, as
  the download is so fast, and the units are "shipped hot," meaning
  that books start accumulating instantly during first power-on.
  Kindle is surprisingly popular among elderly users, for whom the
  adjustable font, light weight and travel-less purchases are major
  advantages.  Increasingly Kindle is mixing up business models,
  as <i>Newsweek</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> have created
  electronic books, while blogs are <i>sold</i> as periodicals on the
  Kindle.  Amazon requires no contract with the Kindle but it remains
  a "walled garden."  Amazon's overall sales are over half
  international, but the Kindle won't be rolled out overseas until it
  is perfected in the U.S.  Negotiations with publishers are the main
  gating item.  Color eInk remains too power-hungry.  Kindle customers
  spend 2.6x as much on Amazon products after their purchase compared
  to before.
</p>

<h3>Session 4: Open mobile ecosystem: software and application innovation</h3>

<p><b>Mary McDowell, Nokia:</b> Nokia has about a 1/3 market share for
all phones on the planet; currently 1 billion Nokia phones are under
contract.  72 million Nokia smartphones will be sold in 2008 compared
to a 180 million total market.  Nokia is also by volume the world's
leading vendor of GPS receivers and cameras.  Meanwhile, 80% of the
world's inhabitants live within range of a cell tower, and more users
accessed the Internet in 2008 using handsets than using PCs.  Needs
are different in developing nations where an entire family will share
a handset, and each needs his/her own contact list.  Applications
which are popular in emerging markets are also different.  Educational
software is extremely popular in China through the MobileDo service.
External developers have created irrigation planning and diabetes
management applications, the latter of which is based on a dongle
sensor.  An architectural information application for tourists is
under development, as is an anti-counterfeiting application for luxury
goods that is based on NFC.  An NFC-based micropayment trial with
Vodafone is going forward in Africa.  Nokia also is working on
handsets as environmental sensors.  UC Berkeley and Nokia Research
Center in Palo Alto are developing
a <a href="http://traffic.berkeley.edu/">traffic-tracking app</a>
based on data collected from handset GPS devices. </p>

<p>Developers have suffered from the "snowflake problem" with mobile
handsets; handset manufacturers have not shown discipline with their
APIs.  The seriousness of Nokia's push into Internet services can be
judged by the amount of investment they've made into the acquisitions
of NavTeq, Symbian, Oz Technology (social networking) and TrollTech.
Symbian has 1700 employees, 2/3 of whom are engineers.  In most
contexts, the main limitation on handset performance is now power
consumption rather than network availability, storage or processor
performance.  By next year, Symbian will support seamless, transparent
hand-off of connectivity between WiFi and 3G for roaming users. The
open-sourcing of Symbian now will not be completed until 2010.</p>

</p>

<p><b>Rich Miner, Google:</b> The importance of the mobile handset
  cannot be overestimated.  The world has 1.5 billion credit cards,
  850 million cars, 1.3 billion televisions and 3 billion mobile
  handsets.  Rich Miner was the co-founder of Android, which was later
  acquired by Google.  Already Android has forced all handset
  manufacturers consider the sale of unlocked phones and, in
  conjunction with the iPhone, has made all telcos consider unlimited
  data plans.  The changes will spur innovation in the industry.
  Miner got the idea for Android while working for
  <a name="orange" id="orange">Orange</a>, which was debuting the
  first Windows Mobile handset.  A bug in Windows Mobile prevented
  Orange's new push-to-talk service from working with the handset, and
  Microsoft took 18 months to issue a patch!  Meanwhile, he could not
  get Orange product managers to install internally developed
  applications or those developed by Orange-acquired start-ups onto
  the handsets whose release they managed.  With Android, the
  community will quickly fix bugs, and any user can install any app
  that he or she wants.  On most platforms, native code and Java apps
  run in separate spaces and can barely interact; the browser for
  example does not have access to the contacts list.  Android has no
  separation between privileged native code and developer-contributed
  Java.  Also, applications can be self-signed, and the fee to join
  the Android store is only $25.  ShopSavvy is an app that gives
  competing stores' price information based on the scan of a product's
  barcode.</p>

  <p>Thirty-plus companies have signed up for the Open Handset Alliance,
  with telco partners announced in Japan, China and Europe.  Several
  handset manufacturers have shown Google handsets running Android
  including some based on CDMA.  Google is not directly involved in
  these efforts; any negotiations are between handset manufacturers
  and the telcos.  The main Android contributions are a JVM optimized
  for the ARM processor, Surface Manager (2D graphics), OpenGLES (3D
  graphics) plus a few simple applications (clock, calculator, etc.).
  Google likes the iPhone because its owners frequently access Google
  mobile products.</p>

  <p>The main advantage of Android for developers is that there will
  be only one JVM, and Android will always run on the latest Linux
  kernel.  The concept of "porting" doesn't exist on the Android
  platform.  Soon Google will announce a test suite that all compliant
  handsets should run, plus a list of endorsed 3rd-party applications
  that are recommended for pre-installation.  Google's only
  enforcement will be to recommend that telcos not offer non-compliant
  handsets.  Every program under Android runs as a different UID in
  the Unix sense, which prevents applications from reading each
  other's data.  Accessing other applications' data requires an API
  call.</p>
</p>

<h3>Session 5: Any Device?   Feature phones, smartphones and more</h3>


<p><b>Gary Willihnganz, Intel:</b> Carriers outside the U.S. are
  starting to subsidize netbooks and other smaller mobile internet
  devices.   Business models are getting blurred; already the top
  music site in France is run by a telco!     Batteries and displays
  remain the main cost in handset manufacture, although software is up
  to 23%.
</p>


<p><b>Elizabeth Altman, Motorola:</b>More single-purpose devices like
  the Kindle that do only one function well are on their way into the
  marketplace.  Motorola already ships Linux-based handsets overseas
  and is planning to support Linux and Android going forward.
</p>

<h3>Session 6: How to foster innovation: open vs. closed ecosystems</h3>

<p><b>J.T. Treadwell, Symphony Technology Group (VCs):</b>Apple's
  iPhone store is the equivalent of a record label: they are ripping
  off small developers the way that labels rip off musicians.
  Openness and consolidation are what make the previously unattractive
  mobile market suddenly look more lucrative for investors and
  developers.  The mobile ecosystem will be healthy when there are
  $20-50 million companies as well as giants and ma-and-pas.  The
  biggest problem for startups has been big companying simply copying
  their ideas.  The biggest growth area will be enterprise mobile apps
  rolling out on phones.
</p>

<h3>Session 7: Apps in the Cloud</h3>

<p><b>Fabrizio Capobianco, Funambol:</b> "Push" technologies have a
  big advantage on mobile in environment where connectivity will
  always be unreliable.  Synchronization is the right underlying
  technology.  Funambol (whose technology is an implementation of
  SyncML) is the largest natively mobile open-source project.
  Fragmentation actually helps small open-source developers, as it
  gives them an opportunity for niche development
  (e.g. internationalization) that doesn't interest the big players.
  The inability to customize the iPhone will limit its international
  sales, as the iPhone is very much aimed at the U.S. market.
</p>

<p><b>Jay Sullivan, Mozilla Mobile:</b> The problem of fragmentation
  on mobile is exaggerated.  Browsers work fine on the various
  platforms as long as the content they access is standards-compliant.
  Widgets that use wget or similar to scrape data from the web can
  make browser access of data look like a standalone application.
  Yahoo Confabulator and Nokia WidSet are easy methods for widgetizing
  browser calls.  Push isn't need for mobile apps as Google Gears and
  SQLite already minimize the pain of intermittent connectivity,
  allowing, for example, type-ahead to continue during a service
  interruption.  The most impressive apparently uninterruptible
  package is the Zimbra mail client.  HTML5 will support Google Gears
  and will be much less annoying in an intermittently connected
  setting.  One-button widgetizing by the user will be supported in
  Mozilla's
  new <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/FennecVision">Fennec
  mobile-optimized browser.</a>
</p>


<p><b>Nick Allott, <a href="http://www.omtp.org/About.aspx">Open
Mobile Terminal Project</a>:</b> OMTP is industry's answer to the
slowness of the W3C process, the pace of whose torturous deliberations
are antithetical to the lightning speed of mobile web development.
OMTP hopes as an early activity to create standards for widgets.  Many
industry heavyweight have signed on to OMTP.  The first initiative
is <a href="http://www.omtp.org/Bondi/">BONDI,</a> which specifically
tries to address cross-platform compatibility.  The most striking
aspect of phones is that processor speeds in new handsets vary by 100x
compared to about 2x on new desktops.  Clearly there are diverse
business models!
</p>

<h3>Session 8: Mobile advertising and the open mobile economy</h3>

<p><b>Jason Spero, Admob:</b> Admob is an ad-server.  Over thirty
  iPhone apps use their service.  Phone owners react to SMS ads the
  same way they do to direct mail: the ads are very annoying if they
  aren't well targeted.  A major trend in mobile advertising is free
  simple games that feature a brand.  Admob's slots are 95% sold out.
  Ad click-throughs on the iPhone are 1.5% compared to 1% on
  featurephones.  The ability to link voice communication to ads has
  not yet been exploited; it's an area of opportunity for developers.
  On phones without GPS, Admob is beginning to use weather and traffic
  data downloads to figure out location.
</p>

<p><b>Gene Keenan, Isobar:</b> Keenan employs 50 people in a
  subsidiary of a giant advertising agency.  Isobar is the biggest
  buyer of mobile ads after Procter &#38; Gamble.  Telcos often take
  48 weeks to approve a new ringtone, while Apple will typically sign
  an app for its store in 2 days.  Mobile advertising still tends to
  be an after-thought, not the focus of specially designed campaigns.
  A sign of increasing sophistication is that advertisers are just
  beginning to target particular advertisements to consumers who own
  particular models of phones.
</p>

<p><b>Jai Jaisimha, AOL:</b> AOL hosts the number site aimed
  specifically at men!  [The most memorable thing he said.]  AOL sees
  a bright future in serving ads for mobile.  A no-cost, ad-supported
  phone called Blic with capped access time will soon be available in
  Europe.
</p>
