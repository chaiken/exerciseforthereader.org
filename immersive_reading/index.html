<h3><a name="motivation">Motivation</a></h3>

<p>If you're like me, you read a lot of documentation and other
  detailed technical material.   Sometimes the documentation is poorly
  written or confusing and I have trouble concentrating.   The hardest
  material to concentrate on is patent applications.    I can barely
  bring myself to read more than a half page of claims at a time even
  when I have a deadline.
</p>

<p>As a side note, I've been thinking a lot about assistive
  technologies due to my professional work on <a href="http://meego.com/devices/in-vehicle">"in-vehicle
  infotainment"</a> systems for drivers.    A moment's consideration
  shows that a driver is essentially a blind computer user, so a lot
  of assistive technologies may be adaptable for in-car use.

<h3><a name="inspiration">Inspiration: Audio Files for Language Study</a></h3>

<p>Recently I've been studying Finnish at night with the assistance of
  audio and video files whose intention is to improve pronunciation.
  The videos did not include written text to compare with the audio,
  and I found them hard to understand and useless.   The
  audio files featured native speakers reading sentences that
  corresponded to print in a textbook.    Reading the book while
  listening to the audio and repeating after the speakers not only
  improved my pronunciation, it also immensely helped my retention of
  vocabulary.   I could remember words that I'd heard on the recording
  much better than those I had not.
</p>

<p>It occurred to me that listening to audio derived from
  documentation while reading the documentation might help me focus
  and retain material better and lately I've been trying it out.
  Somehow the brain hack of listening to a stream that I must 
  intentionally  pause immensely reduces my tendency for distraction.
  Put on headphones, open your PDF file, crank up the volume and give
  it a try!

<h3><a name="orca">Why Not Orca?</a></h3>

<div class="figure"><p><img src="orca2-sm.jpg" alt="Orca logo" /></p></div>

<p>Gnome comes with the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Orca">Orca</a>
  assistive technology package that will read just about any window
  out loud.  Orca does work with PDFs, but really poorly in my
  experience.  For every slide, the audio includes the metadata, and I
  had to keep moving the mouse around to get the page content to play.
  There may well be a way to configure Orca to speak PDFs better, but
  I haven't found one.
  Please <a href="mailto:alchaiken@gmail.com">email me</a> if you
  know.</p>
<p>Orca also tends to cause the Gnome desktop to hang on my fully
   patched Fedora 14 system as of today (March 3, 2011).  My solution,
   while clunky and minimally featureful, may SEGV on your system for
   all I know, but it will not hang your desktop and necessitate a
   reboot! If you use Orca, you may want to study up on the <a
   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key">Magic Sysrq
   keys</a>.  ALT-SYSRQ-R-E-I-S-U-B is your friend.  In Fedora, set
   "kernel.sysrq = 1" in /etc/sysctl.conf.

<h3><a name="alternative">An Alternative Approach Based on totem, pdftotext and text2wave</a></h3>

<div class="figure"><p><img src="9x_125x125_3_0.gif" alt="SCALE 9x logo" /></p></div>

<p>Inspired by
  a <a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale9x/presentations/multimedia-command-line">talk
  at SCALE 9x by Dallas Legan</a> and by a subsequent conversation
  with <a href="http://prgmr.com/xen/">my buddy Sarah Newman</a>, I've
  hacked up a solution that works for me.  The basic idea is to use
  the very basic <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/totem/">totem
  media player</a> that comes with Gnome to play the audio stream so
  that it can be backed up and scrolled ahead.  As far as I can make
  out, orca doesn't allow this kind of fine-grained control.
</p>
<p>The gist of the implementation is to pipe output from pdftotext to
  text2wave to totem.   While the gstreamer player gst-launch that underlies
  totem will play from stdin, I've had trouble getting totem to do so
  reproducibly.   For shorter PDF files, totem streams from stdin, but
  for longer files it complains that it can't determine the type.  
</p>
<p>Works:</p>
<pre>
cat /tmp/dbus.wav | gst-launch-0.10 playbin uri=fd://0
</pre>
<p>Not so much:</p>
<pre>
[alison@bonnet UPnP]$ cat /tmp/dbus.wav | totem file://fd://0
** Message: Error: Could not open resource for reading.
gstgiosrc.c(324): gst_gio_src_get_stream (): /GstPlayBin2:play/GstURIDecodeBin:uridecodebin0/GstGioSrc:source:
Could not open location file://fd://0 for reading: Operation not supported
[alison@bonnet UPnP]$ cat /tmp/dbus.wav | totem uri:fd://0
** Message: Error: No URI handler implemented for "uri".
[alison@bonnet UPnP]$ cat /tmp/dbus.wav | totem uri=fd://0
gstfilesrc.c(1034): gst_file_src_start (): /GstPlayBin2:play/GstURIDecodeBin:uridecodebin0/GstFileSrc:source:
No such file "/home/alison/UPnP/uri=fd:/0"
</pre>


<h3><a name="installation">Installation of sayPDF totem-based solution</a></h3>

<ol>
<li><a href="sayPDF.tar.bz2">Get the files.</a></li>
<li>tar xjf sayPDF.tar.bz2</li>
<li>If you have already installed festival and its voices, you're all
  set.  Otherwise on Fedora 14 or similar, try
  "./CommandLineAudioInstallFedora" to get the required packages.
  Note that Fedora by default installs the voices in the wrong directory.</li>
<li>Move the festivalrc file to .festivalrc in your home directory.
  You can change the playback speed or try different voices by editing
  ~/.festivalrc.</li>
<li>If you like, move the bash and perl executables to a bin directory
  on your $PATH.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="running">Running sayPDF totem-based solution</a></h3>
<p>Play file dbus.pdf from pages 2 through 5 using totem:</p>
<pre>sayPDF_totem -f 2 -l 5 -i /tmp/dbus.pdf 
</pre>
<p>Play the same file using gstreamer directly:</p>
<pre>sayPDF_gst-launch -f 2 -l 5 -i /tmp/dbus.pdf 
</pre>
<p>Note that text2wave is a CPU-intensive program.   If you want to
   listen to a PDF on (for example) a netbook, you may want to
   ssh into a beefier machine and process the file there. Running the
   program with the -v flag will tell you what the Wav filename is so
   that you can cp it out of /tmp.
</p>


<h3><a name="notes">Miscellaneous Notes</a></h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li>espeak, a component of <a
  href="http://live.gnome.org/Orca/SpeechDispatcher">speech-dispatcher</a>,
  offers the ability to change the reading speed at invocation-time in a
  script, but its voices are inferior to festival. espeak has superior
  support for foreign languages and a cool phoneme-output mode, but is
  not particularly easy to use or stable.</li>
<li>Consider setting an audio play-pause keyboard shortcut so that you
  don't have to change back and forth to a totem window from your PDF
  reader if you want to linger over a particular page.  In Gnome 2.x, go
  to System . . . Preferences . . . Keyboard Shortcuts and set "Play (or
  play/pause)" to a convenient binding.  I chose WindowsKey-space.</li>
<li>A fascinating aspect of using the program is that I can see that I
  need to listen to documentation of different complexity at different
  speeds.   I've been using 60% of the default speed, while most
  Festival users apparently speed it up.   Perhaps long-time listeners
  are simply more skilled and I will get faster over time.   I'm not
  sure how my listening speed will compare to my normal reading speed,
  but I don't really care given that the goal is retention, not rapid
  completion of a meaningless exercise.
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="wishlist">Features to be Added</a></h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A highlighting cursor moving through the document view as the
audio progresses.  Maybe could be a <a
href="http://xournal.sourceforge.net/">xournal</a> hack? (H/T andreas_ on Freenode)</li>
<li>Changing speed of audio stream on the fly (Gnome already offers many
  methods of changing volume)</li>
<li>Changing voices on a per-document basis</li>
<li>Hyperlink-following method for HTML documents (not likely to be
  coded by me!)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3><a name="speak">An Alternative Approach from Kyle Rankin</a></h3>

<div class="figure"><p><img src="cat.gif" alt="Cover of Kyle Rankin's book" /></p></div>

<p>The ever-inspiring <a href="http://www.greenfly.org/">Kyle
    Rankin</a> offers an alternative approach in his
    book <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596100766/">Linux
    Multimedia Hacks</a>.   Kyle generously allowed me to include his
    perl script speak.pl in the tarball above.   For reasons I don't
    understand, on my Fedora system I must invoke it as "perl
    speak.pl &lt;filename&gt;" rather than having an executable called
    "speak" that I invoke as "speak &lt;filename&gt;."  Kyle's solution only
    works with text files, which is displays as it speaks them.   His
    script also adds end-of-sentence and end-of-paragraph pauses
    better than default festival.
