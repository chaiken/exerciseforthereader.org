      </p>Ever heard of <a href="http://www.toad.com/gnu/">John

      Peterson</a>?  Then John Sundman's "nanoscopically famous
      technoparanoid thriller" is well worth your attention.
      <em>Acts</em> is a plot-driven, well-paced novel that
      still manages to get most of its electrical engineering and
      biotech details right.  Unlike Tom Clancy, Sundman features
      realistic well-rounded characters (including many female ones)
      that you will still be able to tell apart after a few hundred
      pages.  The realism of the characters stems from the fact that
      they are almost all based on actual people, many of whom you may
      recognize if you've been hanging about in Cambridge and Palo
      Alto for a few years.  A portion of <em>Acts</em> is <a
      href="http://www.wetmachine.com/acts/introduction.shtml">available
      on-line for free</a>, but you should really be old-fashioned and
      <a href="http://www.wetmachine.com/order/index.shtml">buy the

          <em>Ellis Island and Other Stories</em> and
          <em>A Soldier of the Great War</em>, both by Mark
          Helprin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first volume contains my favorite short story ever,
          "The Schreuderspitze," while the second is a novel about
          WWII in Italy. Both works are about coping with loss by
          finding solace in the beauty of nature, and both are
          poignant enough to move many a reader to tears. "The
          Schreuderspitze" is one of the few works of fiction
          (along with <em>Murder in the Cathedral</em>, see
          below) that I have read more than one time as an adult.
          In fact, I have read it dozens of times. If you are
          obsessive about getting regular exercise, you must read
          this story! <em>A Soldier of the Great War</em>
          is marred by some implausible turns of plot, but the
          loveliness of the images (mostly avian and lunar) carry
          the reader easily over the few rough places. The
          descriptions of Alpine battles are gripping. Helprin is
          one of the few novelists (like my other favorite,
          <a href="../pursuit.html">James Dickey</a>) who can
          describe adventure in as irreproachable a way as he
          describes interpersonal relations or scenery. Mark
          Helprin really is the writer that people wish Hemingway
          was.

          <a><em>Brazzaville Beach</em> by William Boyd</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          This fascinating book takes place both in Cornwall and
          Africa (Mozambique? or Angola?) and contains insights
          about plant biology, human evolution, and the graduate
          school life. For sheer originality and interest of plot,
          <em>Brazzaville Beach</em> is a winner. The
          narration is fairly simple and linear, for people who
          prefer that type of thing. One wonders if this book is a
          <em>roman a clef</em> about the Leakeys, Goodall/von
          Lawicks or whoever, or if it is all fanciful.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the same author, <em>Stars and Bars</em> was a
          great disappointment. Englishmen may be a bit
          overambitious trying to do a comic Southern Gothic novel.
          I should have been warned off the "zany frolic" quotes on
          the cover (but it was a library book). <em>A Good Man
          in Africa</em>, on the other hand, is a hoot. The
          comic struggles of poor everyman Morgan Leafy against the
          world's worst boss in utterly impossible circumstances
          will arouse amused sympathy in every reader. <em>A
          Good Man in Africa</em> has the hilarity that
          <em>Stars and Bars</em> aspired to but lacked.

        <p>
          <em>The Second Coming</em> by <a href=
          "http://sunsite.unc.edu/wpercy/homepage.html">Walker
          Percy</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Like many of Percy's books, a moving and sympathetic
          portrait of mental illness. Anomie portrayed in an
          appealing way. <em>The Moviegoer</em> by the same
          author is also one of my personal favorites but the
          characters in <em>TSC</em> are more sympathetic.
          Some other books by Percy are either too depressing
          (<em>Lancelot</em>) or too strange (<em>Love
          among the Ruins</em>) for my taste. <em>The
          Second Coming</em> is actually a sequel to
          <em>The Last Gentleman</em>, also good, and which
          should probably be read first.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Dog Soldiers</em> by <a href=
          "http://www.robotwisdom.com/jorn/stone.html">Robert
          Stone</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          So beautiful it hurts. One version of the truth about
          America, although not a book to read if you're already
          depressed. The long shadow of the Vietnam War is here
          described by a survivor in a way that's not easy to
          forget. Probably my favorite novel ever, although I
          reserve the right to change my mind!
        </p>
        <p>
          By the same author, <em>Outerbridge Reach</em>,
          about a round-the-world sailing contest, is a bit grim
          and predictable despite being well-written. <em>A
          Flag for Sunrise</em> tells the story of a
          missionary's self-destruction in the midst of a guerilla
          war. This book is a surprising reminder of just how
          concerned we all were with Central America in the early
          '80s. <em>Children of Light</em>, Stone's novel
          about Hollywood, is a nasty story about self-pitying
          types who only get what's coming to them. <em>A Hall
          of Mirrors</em> has a similar plot (Boy gets
          half-crazed Girl, Boy loses her) but more sympathetic
          characters and a truly creepy New Orleans setting. The
          final over-the-top denouement is reminiscent of James
          Dickey's <em>Alnilam</em> in that the author
          seems to lose control of the plot a bit. I'm looking
          forward to reading <em>Bear and His
          Daughter</em>, the new book of stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stone's most recent novel <a href=
          "http://www.aljadid.com/reviews/0526mccabe.html"><em>Damascus
          Gate</em></a> is his strongest since <em>Dog
          Soldiers</em>. While the essential theme of a
          troubled seeker embroiled in problems he barely
          understands is unchanged, <em>Damascus Gate</em>
          benefits from getting out of the main character's head
          into modern Jerusalem and its environs. The book has too
          many subplots and is at times as bewildering as a
          shoot-em-up movie. Nevertheless the exotic religious
          elements and the description of the real suffering of
          real people in the Gaza Strip enliven what could
          otherwise have been an unfulfilling trip to the same old
          well. You get the feeling while reading these novels that
          Stone wants to shake Americans as a group out of their
          national self-absorption and complacency. While Stone's
          male leads still fail movingly and heroically, he does
          seem to be getting a bit more sentimental. Perhaps he's
          working up to a happy ending in his next book.

          <em>Swimming in the Volcano</em> by <a href=
          "http://www.zinezone.com/zones/arts/literature/non-fiction/shacochis/interview.html">
          Bob Shacochis</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          I initially picked this book up from the remainders table
          in Barnes and Noble because I thought it was
          <em>Under the Volcano</em>. Realizing it was not,
          I was about to put it back when I saw the jacket blurb
          from Robert Stone and decided to give it a try. The first
          chapter made me think I was rereading Boyd's picaresque
          <a href="#boyd"><em>Good Man in Africa</em></a>,
          but from then on it was clear we were in <a href=
          "#stone">Stone</a> Country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shahochis' novel is the tale of a group of well-meaning
          expatriates coming apart both individually and
          collectively on a Caribbean island during the late
          1970's. As in Stone's novel, there are drugs, psychoses,
          and innocent people getting hurt, but there's also
          stunningly lyrical writing to describe it all. Despite
          the fact that the main characters are affluent Americans,
          the island setting is much more than a backdrop.
          Shacochis' descriptions of the juxtaposition of affluence
          and privation, tropical paradise and third world hell,
          government corruption and social privilege all will stay
          with the reader long after the book is put down.
          Shacochis has got Stone's paranoia down, and a surprise
          ending too! I will certainly be looking for more of
          Shacochis' books.

          <a name="eliot"><em>Murder in the Cathedral</em> and
          <em>Four Quartets</em> by T.S. Eliot</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not Catholic and don't care a bit about religion but the
          poetry and prose in these works draw me back again and
          again. When I am stuck in my writing, I reread some of
          <em>Murder in the Cathedral</em> or <em>Four
          Quartets</em>.  They have never yet failed to get me
          going.  Eliot's writing shows not only a mastery of the
          language but a deep insight into the ways that the mind
          wanders.  His sensation of the ever-presence of the past is
          almost creepy.

          <em>Song of Solomon</em> by <a href=
          "http://www.bookwire.com/qbr/canon/morrison.html">Toni
          Morrison</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Morrison deserved to win the Nobel, and here's the proof.
          Yeah, I realize that lots of politically correct
          one-book-wonders have won, but Morrison is in a totally
          different category.
        </p><em>Song of Solomon</em> is not as chilling or
        creepy as Morrison's Pulitzer-winning
        <em>Beloved</em>, but it's one of the more
        believable and uplifting works of literature I've read in a
        long time. Morrison is one of those writers who can reveal
        the very worst about the human condition and yet can
        deliver a convincing happy ending. Her latest,
        <em>Jazz</em>, is not her best.<br />

        <em>Light in August</em> or <em>Absalom,
        Absalom</em> by Faulkner
        <p>
          Regular folks can read these and enjoy, unlike <em>As
          I Lay Dying</em> or <em>The Sound and the
          Fury</em>, which have to be read with a critical
          commentary in one hand. <em>Light in August</em>
          is one of the few books of reasonable length that I
          actually read in one sitting. I got so absorbed in it
          that I forgot to eat, drink or piss. My other Faulkner
          favorite is <em>Absalom, Absalom</em>, although
          of course many of them are very good. <em>The
          Reivers</em> and the Snopes Trilogy, for example,
          show that Faulkner also knew how to be funny.

          <em>The Goldbug Variations</em> by Richard Powers
        </p>
        <p>
          This book is a meditation on Bach and computer science
          and genetics, but it is an <em>erotic</em> work of
          fiction, not a collection of <em>Scientific
          American</em> articles. <em>The Goldbug
          Variations</em> follows Powers' interesting
          <em>The Prisoner's Dilemma</em> which is loosely
          about the ideas of game theory and nuclear testing.
          <em>TGV</em>, appears to be loosely based on the
          life story of John Nash, a founder of game theory who
          developed a serious mental condition and dropped out of
          sight for many years. <em>TGV</em> takes place in
          a graduate lab at the University of Illinois in the
          '50's, when the secrets of DNA are being unlocked, and in
          the present, in a computer lab in NYC. Like McPhee's
          books, I enjoy Powers' works just because they present
          scientists as flesh-and-blood humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Operation Wandering Soul</em> and
          <em>Prisoner's Dilemma</em> are not as good. In
          the first, Powers' usually tortured writing style veers
          off into pure incomprehensibility at the end. I liked
          most of the book, but I could barely read the last
          chapter or two. <em>Prisoner's Dilemma</em>
          suffers from having a rather unsympathetic main character
          whose mysterious preoccupation turns out to be
          surprisingly banal. Nonetheless both of these books have
          more intellectual content and more provocative cultural
          commentary than a dozen other offerings at the local
          paperback warehouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Galatea 2.2</em> is Powers at his
          self-absorbed worst. The male narrator is unsympathetic,
          and as a woman (and therefore an expert), I'd judge him
          to be a creep. The plot of <em>G 2.2</em> is very
          high-concept, and the narrative is full of annoying
          emotional string-pulling. It pains me to see that this
          novel appears to be largely autobiographical. Peter
          Matthiessen's <em>Nine-Headed Dragon River</em>
          is a similar bad book by a great writer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Gain</em> finds Powers in his finest form
          since <em>The Goldbug Variations</em>. In
          resonant parallel stories of the rise of an American
          corporation and the death of a cancer patient, Powers
          revisits several of his obsessions, for example the
          terminal illness of a family member and the significance
          of worlds fairs, both featured before in
          <em>Prisoners Dilemma</em>. Presumably Powers has
          chosen "Gain" as the title since "Loss" would be too
          obvious.
        </p>

          Don't forget to read Tom LeClair's <a href=

        <em>The Woman Warrior</em> by Maxine Hong Kingston
        <p>
          This is one of the most honest memoirs (or fiction?) I've
          ever read. Kingston grew up in a Chinatown in the Central
          Valley of California, born to parents who had been
          professionals in the old country and who ran a laundry
          here in America. Kingston's tale is a bit disturbing and
          shocking in its revelation of hypocrisy and mysogyny in
          her family's daily life; <em>TWW</em> is sort of
          the dark side of <em>The Joy Luck Club</em>. In
          Kingston's book, the families never reconcile and the
          children never get sentimental about their parents'
          quaint customs. While I don't think Amy Tan's books are
          bad, they certainly are sappier and less refreshing than
          Kingston's.

        <em>Post Office</em> and <em>Factotum</em>
        by Charles Bukowski
        <p>
          Not only are Bukowski's novels some of the funniest books
          ever written, but they are also some of the most
          poignant. <a href=
          "http://www.charm.net/~brooklyn/Buk/blinks.html">Charles
          Bukowski</a> was a gambler, a drunk, a whorer, a liar and
          all in all basically a bum, but he was also a fine writer
          who unblinkingly recorded what street life in his corner
          of LA in the '50's and '60's was like. His books tell the
          truth and are definitely not for the faint of heart.
          Happily they are not so gratingly confessional that they
          are painful to read, like bad teen fiction, but instead
          are plainly written. Bukowski didn't have much education,
          so his novels are not ones to enlarge your vocabulary,
          but they will certainly make you think. Some others (like
          <em>Women</em> or <em>Hot Water
          Music</em>) are a bit harder to take than the ones
          I've recommended but are also worth reading. <em>Ham
          on Rye</em> is another Bukowski favorite.

        <em>A Thousand Acres</em> by Jane Smiley
        <p>
          Smiley's novel is a wallow in the dark pit of human
          nature in the same way that Cormac McCarthy's
          <em>Blood Meridian</em> is. As with McCarthy's
          book, all the characters get to reveal their evil side by
          the end. I think Smiley's novel is more powerful and
          disturbing simply because the events take place in such
          an All-American "family values" context, a striking
          juxtaposition also used by film director David Lynch.
          Somehow the ultraviolence in McCarthy's West isn't so
          shocking in the post-Peckingpaugh era, while farm life is
          usually portrayed in the media as almost unrelievedly
          wholesome.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best aspect of Smiley's novel was the
          unpredictability of the plot. Since I had read that the
          book was based on <em>King Lear</em>, I expected
          about halfway through that I knew the ending, and was
          happy to find out that I was wrong. <em>A Thousand
          Acres</em> is more a fugue on the King Lear theme
          than a simple retelling, with the same characters but a
          different sequence of events.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm curious how Smiley's book was received in the
          farmbelt. Obviously the portrayal of life in Iowa was
          rather negative, and Smiley is a faculty member at an
          Iowa university. Did locals rail against Smiley and
          demand a fatwa against her ;-), or was her book received
          as an accurate portrayal of modern farm troubles?

        <a name="vollmann"><em>The Rifles</em></a> by <a href=
        "http://home1.gte.net/csweet/vollmann.htm">William
        Vollmann,</a> Geek Laureate
        <p>
          Don't forget to read Tom LeClair's <a href=
          "http://oz.uc.edu/~sola/LeClair2.htm">fascinating
          critique</a> comparing Powers, Vollmann and David Foster
          Wallace.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The Rifles</em> is a novel which mixes the
          story of Sir John Franklin's failed search for the
          Northwest Passage with an account of modern misery among
          the Inuit. In order to make the whole scheme completely
          overambitious, snippets about the adventures of a
          Vollmann alter-ego and the badly treated women in his
          life are thrown in.
        </p>
        <p>
          This description makes the novel sound like an incoherent
          and self-aggrandizing pastiche, which it is not. In fact,
          Vollmann writes like a well-educated and well-traveled
          Bukowski, on the one hand dazzling you with insights
          about polar expeditions and natural history and on the
          other revealing painful and shameful self-knowledge.
          Vollmann is a prolific and talented writer who should
          link up with a stern editor. I look forward to reading
          his other books in the "Seven Dreams" series about the
          history of North America, especially since I am
          fascinated with polar exploration. (See comments about
          <a href="nonfict.html#arctic">Arctic Dreams</a>
          elsewhere.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The first book in the North American history saga,
          <em>The Ice-Shirt</em>, concentrates on the Norse
          explorers and colonizers of Iceland, Greenland and
          Newfoundland. The sections about Eric the Red and his
          forebears in Iceland are full of fascinating tidbits
          about Scandinavian history, Viking raids, and Norse
          mythology. As always, the descriptions of the frozen
          northern landscape are enough to make the reader shiver.
          The sections about Freydis Eriksdottir go on too long and
          get grotesque to the point of sheer silliness by the end,
          spoiling the book's somber mood.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Vollmann masterwork <em>You Bright and Risen
          Angels</em> is an epic tale of an apocalyptic battle
          between intelligent insects and humans for control of the
          planet. The humans are all cold and scheming electrical
          engineers, harnessing the power of the electron to
          enslave nature, while the insects are loyal, loving and
          sympathetic. The antihero Bug is a human who has gone
          over to the side of the insects, while the antihero
          Parker is a plant who supports the engineers. The
          community of snakes, super-testerone-guy Wayne and the
          Great Beetle all play major roles. Wayne's semaphoric
          interrogation of an insect prisoner-of-war is alone worth
          the price of the book. Of course to describe
          <em>YBRA</em> in this way is to make it sound
          much more linear and plot-driven than it really is. In
          fact, it's a sprawling, sometimes frustrating mess, like
          <em>Gravity's Rainbow</em>, with flashes of
          bitter and sly humor worthy of Pynchon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vollmann's <em>The Atlas</em> on the other hand is
          simply a mess. There's an arty explanation about the
          palindromic organization of the stories in the book, but
          this exposition appears to be a weak attempt to cover up
          the fact that <em>The Atlas</em> is mostly a
          fairly miscellaneous collection of magazine pieces. While
          there are scattered passages of piercingly fine writing,
          particularly in the title story, many of the other
          chapters seem like outtakes from a better Vollmann book.
          Vollmann manages to infect the reader with his fascination
          with the unconquerability of the human spirit even in the
          very worst of circumstances, but the self-loathing and
          loneliness in <em>The Atlas</em> are oppressive
          by the end.

          <em>How Late it Was, How Late</em> by James
          Kelman
        </p>
        <p>
          This book is not an easy read: both the semi-fractured
          stream-of-consciousness form and the slightly opaque
          Glaswegian dialect take some getting used to.
          Stream-of-consciousness is rarely done well in my
          opinion, and there just aren't that many people's heads
          you'd want to spend hours inside. I didn't much like
          <em>As I Lay Dying</em> or the Benjy sections of
          <em>The Sound and The Fury</em>, but I found
          <em>How Late it Was, How Late</em> to be a
          page-turner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The narrator Sammy, a mostly unemployed semi-alcoholic,
          is engaging but seemingly authentic. The plot jolts into
          action from the first few pages, when Sammy wakes up in
          jail, suddenly blind. As a newly blind man, Sammy's
          ability to understand the outside world is severely
          limited. His slow trip back to his apartment on foot is
          as harrowing a passage as any I've read. The
          stream-of-consciousness is in this section a very
          effective way of conveying Sammy's understandable despair
          and frequent spells of panic. The reader knows only what
          Sammy knows, except for a few places where an omniscient
          narrator comments. Sammy's growing paranoia and feeling
          of helplessness is vividly conveyed as the reader too is
          unable to decide whether he is going crazy, or whether
          they really are out to get him, or both. The jacket copy
          likens <em>How Late it Was, How Late</em> to
          Joyce, an obvious comparison, but the mood and the plot
          harken back more to <em>The Trial</em>. The
          difference is that Sammy is a more sympathetic and vivid
          character than Joseph K.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book's ending is obviously intentionally ambiguous.
          I'd like to discuss Sammy's fate with anyone else who's
          read it.

          <em>Ratner's Star</em> by <a href=
          "http://www.ksu.edu/english/nelp/delillo/">Don
          DeLillo</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Ratner's Star</em> is yet another <a href=
          "http://oz.uc.edu/~sola/LeClair2.htm">prodigious</a>
          classic, with black humor and amazing accumulation of
          detail like <em>Gravity's Rainbow</em>, only with
          more of a plot. Like <em>GR</em>,
          <em>Ratner's Star</em> is difficult to follow at
          times, but it has an element of suspense that Pynchon's
          work lacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story concerns the trials of Little Billy Twillig, a
          mathematical prodigy, as he wanders through "Field
          Experiment Number One" and "Logicon Project Minus One,"
          two fantastic and strange scientific undertakings peopled
          by dysfunctional staff. The book is by turns disturbing
          and hilarious, much like the work of the master.
          Fourteen-year-old Twillig has been sent to the Field
          Experiment to assist in decoding a radio message received
          from extraterrestrials. Linguists, janitors, relativity
          theorists, Australian aborigines, brain surgeons,
          logicians and academic functionaries variously help and
          hinder the hero as he stumbles towards his destruction.
          DeLillo is no expert on the subject matter of science,
          but he completely understands the pomposity and
          unwarranted weirdness of its many of its most successful
          practitioners. Interludes about Billy's scary childhood
          in the Bronx are equally compelling. My only complaint is
          with the character of Robert Softly, Twillig's mentor,
          whose scenes are uniformly dull.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the same author, a novel about Lee Harvey Oswald called
          <em>Libra</em> is unremarkable.  <em>White Noise</em>
          similarly failed to hold my interest.  The meltdown of the
          suburban family is no more interesting as presented by
          DeLillo than when portrayed by Updike or Heller.  The
          novelty of the Airborne Toxic Event is not enough to relieve
          the slight feeling of tedium.

          <em>Sometimes a Great Notion</em> by Ken Kesey
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a Great American Novel. It is also a replaying of
          the Cain/Abel East Of Eden theme, but SaGN is much
          better-written than the Steinbeck soap. The Stamper family
          characters will stay with the reader a long time after the
          covers are shut. Besides the characterizations, the story is
          full of humor and suspense as well.

          <em>A Hero of Our Time</em> by Mihail Lermontov
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>A Hero of Our Time</em> is a rollicking tale
          of adventure and romance, something of a 19th century
          Russian <em>Les Liaisons dangereuses</em>. The
          hero Gregoriy Pechorin is a conniving and cold-blooded
          cad, and simultaneously a soldier in the war to subjugate
          Chechnya, the same struggle that apparently has been
          going on ever since. While Lermontov's writing can be
          awkward, his story-telling is masterful. The translation
          by the Nabokovs is particularly charming.

          <em>The Club Dumas</em> by Arturo Pérez Reverte
        </p>Pérez Reverte seems to be the Spanish reincarnation of
        Robertson Davies in that he writes stimulating, intricate
        page-turners that absorb and tease readers without
        condescending to them. <em>The Club Dumas</em>
        resembles Davies' <em>Bred in the Bone</em> with
        its tales of forgery and deceipt in the fine arts, but the
        author's remarkable insight into the slick and fickle
        behavior of humankind harks back more to the Deptford
        Trilogy. While the text dwells on demons and Alexandre
        Dumas, the misadventures of antihero Lucas Corso are more
        in the picaresque Spanish tradition.
