          <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel</em> by <a href=
          "http://www.geog.ucla.edu/People/Faculty/diamond/diamond.htm">
          Jared Diamond</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Diamond is a writer whose work I have admired for a long
          time. His columns in <em>Discover</em> magazine in the
          mid-80's were startlingly original and full of ideas.
          Diamond's latest book does not quite meet the same high
          standard, but it is well worth reading nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main thesis of <em>Guns, Germs and Steel</em> is what
          could be called "geographic determinism," namely the idea
          that local ecological and environmental conditions have
          been the most important influence on human history over
          the long haul. Diamond argues convincingly that what has
          made Europeans dominant over the last few centuries was
          their luck in having many valuable food plants and
          domesticable animals native to their region. In addition,
          Diamond points out the advantage that Eurasia had in
          being a continent with an east-west land axis, where
          farming methods developed in one region could readily be
          adopted in neighboring regions with similar climates.
          This east-west axis stands in contrast to the primarily
          north-south axis of the Americas, where the north Mexican
          desert and tropical jungle of the Panamanian isthmus
          effectively isolated farming communities in temperate
          regions from one another. Diamond argues that the racist
          explanation for European domination doesn't make hold up
          under close examination, and he has the statistics, maps
          and citations to make his case.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel</em> is full of fascinating
          information, for example about how linguistics can be
          used to trace mass human movements, and how migratory
          populations repeatedly replaced less-developed ones even
          before the advent of colonialism. The story of how
          Polynesians colonized Madagascar and how Atahuallpa, the
          head Inca, surrendered to Pizzarro are alone worth the
          price of the book. Diamond's commentary is wide-ranging,
          touching lightly on subject as diverse as why the Chinese
          failed to colonize Africa, why the Aztecs invented the
          wheel but used it only in toys, and why Koreans have the
          world's most advanced writing system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book grows a bit repetitive by the end as the primary
          arguments are pounded into the reader over and over. One
          chapter about the evolution of governments seems like an
          afterthought. The included photos are strangely
          irrelevant. Nonetheless, <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel</em>
          is a tour de force of research that truly deserves the
          praise heaped on it. I'm hoping that publishers will now
          be convinced to bring out a collection of Diamond's
          <em>Discover</em> columns. They are at least as readable
          as Stephen Jay Gould's popular book series.

          <em>The Fatal Shore</em> by <a href=
          "http://www.pbs.org/wnet/australia/bio.html">Robert
          Hughes</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This book, almost as long as <em><a href=
          "vietnam.html#lie">A Bright Shining Lie</a></em>, is
          about the early settlement of Australia and its history
          as a penal colony. I'd be very interested to hear what
          Aussies think of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The Fatal Shore</em> is quite a human
          interest story. The suffering of the earlier settlers is
          almost beyond imagination nowadays. Yet their lot was
          scarcely worse than that of many of the poor in
          18th-century Ireland and England, so prisoners kept
          coming.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stories of amazing prison escapes in this book
          reminds me of volume II of <em>The Gulag
          Archipelago</em>. Overall, <em>The Fatal
          Shore</em> is like Solzhenitsyn's work in featuring
          inspiring stories of human persistence against
          totalitarian systems. And the story of the slow
          accumulation of civil liberties by former prisoners and
          their offspring will interest anyone who cares about
          human rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          The careers of several inhuman prison wardens are
          described in detail. Are there such people in power in
          prisons nowadays in the democratically governed world?
          One can only hope not.
        </p>
        <p>
          My only gripe with <em>The Fatal Shore</em> is
          that it ends a bit prematurely with the of termination of
          prisoner "transportation." It's left to the reader's
          imagination to guess how the "convict stain" was wiped
          out of the Australian imagination and how Australia
          became a modern nation. But <em>The Fatal
          Shore</em> is definitely worth a read.

          <a name="mcphee"><em>Rising from the Plain</em></a> by <a
          href= "http://www.johnmcphee.com/">John McPhee</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I personally have really enjoyed McPhee's geology
          foursome, if only because they present scientists
          (geologists specifically) to be appealing people. While
          there is some mineralogy jargon in McPhee's geology
          series, the reader can comfortably ignore it. You don't
          have to know any technical terms to find fascinating the
          descriptions of the California gold rush or to enjoy
          reading about the raging debate over how the Appalachians
          formed. I recommend this book of the four (<em>Basin and
          Range</em>, <em>In Suspect Terrain</em>, and
          <em>Assembling California</em> are the other three)
          specifically because featured geologist David Love is the
          most interesting character to appear in the series. The
          account of Love's childhood on the Wyoming frontier is
          refreshingly unromanticized. Ironically Love played a
          major role in despoiling the landscape of his youth by
          finding large uranium deposits near where he grew up.

          <em>My Traitor's Heart</em> by <a href=
          "http://www.icon.co.za/~whyle/MALAN.htm">Rian Malan</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Malan is a descendent of the family that
          institutionalized apartheid in South Africa. Overburdened
          by guilt and fear, he left the country and lived for
          years in Los Angeles. This book is the story of his
          return home to examine South Africa anew. The greatest
          strength of Malan's account is that it really is about
          South Africa and is not at all egocentric.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is much fascinating information in Malan's book.
          Learn who Steven Biko really was, and read about the
          horrible violence between his Black Consciousness
          Movement faction and the African National Congress. Read
          descriptions of black mistreatment in the '70's and '80's
          that rival for horror anything you've heard from the
          American slavery period. Get a feeling for the lives of
          everyday blacks in Soweto. Learn about black serial
          killers and understand the perilous position of liberals
          like Malan during the ongoing upheaval. This is a
          completely fascinating book, a true non-fiction
          pageturner, but not lurid.

        </p>
        <p>
          If you live in the American West, especially in
          California, then you really should read this lively
          history of western water projects. Besides amazing tales
          of political corruption and dam failures, there are
          sickening stories of agricultural subsidies,
          environmental tragedies and engineering incompetence.
          Learn about the long-time rivalry between the Army Corps
          of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. If this
          incident hadn't been so expensive to taxpayers, it would
          be much more funny. Did you know that all of America's
          dams are silting up, so that reservoir capacity is
          decreasing, and that no one knows a solution?

        <em><a>Arctic Dreams</a></em> by <a href=
        "http://www.barclayagency.com/lopez.html">Barry Lopez</a>
        <p>
          My favorite natural history book would have to be
          <em>Arctic Dreams</em>. Part history of the
          arctic region, part natural history lecture, and part
          adventure travel book, this is a fascinating read. Lopez
          traveled all over the arctic talking to native people,
          watching wildlife, and brooding over the many who lost
          their lives searching for the Northwest Passage. Somehow
          this book manages to be both dreamy and informative at
          the same time. You learn a lot of gee-whiz facts reading
          it, and yet it's beautifully written and goes down
          quickly, like John McPhee. The scenes of sailors
          overwintering on frozen-in ships at the North Pole nearly
          gave me nightmares.

        Daniel Yergin</a>
        <p>
          <em>The Prize</em>, another entertaining
          non-fiction tome, is a history of the global oil
          industry. The size of this book is off-putting, but when
          you finish you will wish it had been longer. Never has
          there been a greater bunch of rascals than the
          wildcatters and tycoons who brought us the modern oil
          industry, and their misadventures, plotting and
          governmental manipulations are set down in detail in
          <em>The Prize</em>. Learn how journalist Ida
          Tarbell brought down Standard Oil, how a Sunday school
          teacher found the East Texas oil fields, how Royal Dutch
          Shell was started by the son of a seashell curio peddlar,
          how Stalin began his career stirring unrest in the oil
          fields of Baku, and much more! Thrill to the tales of
          business mavericks like Boone Pickens and Calouste
          Gulbenkian. Learn much more about British and US
          involvement in the overthrow of the Mossadegh government
          in Iran in the '50s and the downfall of the Shah in the
          '70s. Did you know that the Nobel family originally made
          their money in Azerbaijani oil, and that their main
          competitors were the Rothschilds?

        <em>The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a
        World out of Balance</em> by <a href=
        "http://archive.salon.com/books/int/2001/10/17/garrett/print.html">
        Laurie Garrett</a>
        <p>
          This readable account of the new field of infectious
          disease ecology is the most thoughtful book I've read in
          a long time. Garrett can really write, and she is careful
          to focus on the human side of biotechnology and
          epidemiology, blending all the scientific facts into the
          true stories of real people. Many US journalists have
          taken pains to put real human faces on the AIDS epidemic,
          but Garrett puts human faces on the hantavirus, Ebola
          virus and Bolivian hemorraghic fever epidemics as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fascinating and horrifying facts abound; for example,
          bacteria and viruses can live for years in algal blooms
          floating on the ocean, where they exchange genetic
          material. The hantavirus that caused many reservation
          deaths in the Southwest US is a close cousin of a bug
          that caused illness in many Korean War soldiers, but no
          one knows how it got to the US or changed its
          characteristics. The simian strain of the AIDS virus has
          been with us for a long time; a specimen in the British
          Museum that was collected in the 19th century has been
          shown to be infected!
        </p>
        <p>
          The most impressive aspect of this book, though, is the
          profundity of thinking involved. Garrett sees the sudden
          outbreak of new diseases as a sign of the destruction of
          the planet by humans, and describes the "coming plague"
          as a sort of Toxic Avenger sent to wreak havoc on Homo
          sapiens by dying ecosystems. She makes a strong case that
          the real reasons for the emergence of AIDS and other new
          epidemics (like Legionnaire's Disease and Toxic Shock
          Syndrome) is simply that man's total domination of the
          earth makes him an inviting target biologically. Garrett
          describes quite disturbingly the consequences of habitat
          destruction, decreasing biodiversity, and the witless
          feeding of antibiotics to livestock. In fact, the
          underlying theme of the book is the inexorability of the
          Law of Unintended Consequences. The most tragic example
          is the horrible impact of the introduction of the
          hypodermic to Africa, where the cost in disease
          transmission through the reuse of contaminated needles
          has far outweighed any public health benefit.

        <em>Listening to Prozac</em> by <a href=
        "http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Brown_Alumni_Magazine/98/11-97/features/kramer.html#kramer">
        Peter D. Kramer</a>
        <p>
          When this book was initially released, I felt no interest
          in it, since I assumed it was yet another self-help
          volume, a genre which I avoid. (It seems kind of odd to
          me on general principle that you would start out to help
          yourself by reading a book of someone else's advice.)
          Then I heard an interview with Peter Kramer on NPR and
          changed my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kramer's book is a thought-provoking re-examination of
          what it means to be mentally ill and what the appropriate
          role of personality-changing drugs is in modern society.
          The premise is introduced from the historical point of
          view, with Kramer noting that schizophrenia and
          manic-depression were initially differentiated on the
          basis that they were treatable with different drugs,
          thorazine and lithium. The idea arose that drug response
          was a useful clinical criterion to define different
          mental illnesses. As time went by, physicians found that
          while most severely depressed patients responded well to
          standard drug treatments, such as imipramine, patients
          with less severe maladies, such as compulsion disorders,
          did not improve as much. There was a different class of
          drugs called MAOIs that these patients responded to, but
          MAOIs had serious side effects and not all patients could
          take them. For these patients, the advent of Prozac, a
          MAOI-like drug with few side effects, was a godsend.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fascinating aspect of Prozac is that it typically has
          a positive effect on people whom we would not ordinarily
          consider mentally ill, namely passive, shy or unusually
          selfless people. The question logically follows, are shy
          people mentally ill? Does logical consistency require
          that we classify them as having a mild form of compulsive
          disorder? The more disturbing questions about Prozac
          arise from the fact that patients like the drug's effect.
          Should a physician prescribe Prozac to someone he does
          not believe is ill, so that the patient can perform
          better at his job or in his social life? A <em>Brave
          New World</em> vision if ever there was one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kramer's book is full of interesting information, such as
          the fact that thorazine is an anti-histamine and is
          chemically similar to many over-the-counter allergy
          medicines. <em>Listening to Prozac</em> is a far
          more interesting book than Oliver Sack's <em>The Man
          who Mistook his Wife for a Hat</em>, if only because
          it deals with normal psychology rather than bizarre and
          unique occurrences. Kramer's plain style also goes down
          easier than Sacks's somewhat fussy writing. Another
          lesser work is William Styron's <em>Darkness Made
          Visible</em>, which is hardly worth reading at all.
          (Then again, if you enjoyed <em>Sophie's
          Choice</em> or <em>The Confessions of Nat
          Turner</em>, you might disagree.)

        <em>Fumbling the Future: How Xerox Invented, then
        Ignored, the First Personal Computer</em> by Douglas K.
        Smith and Robert C. Alexander
        <p>
          Who invented the mouse, the bitmap display, the graphical
          user interface, the laser printer, the Ethernet, the
          bus/interrupt system, downloadable fonts and the WYSIWYG
          text editor? If you said, "Wozniak," you are not alone!
          This book should be required reading for anyone with a
          "Windows '95, Apple '85" bumper sticker since there
          should really be a "Xerox '80" appended at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smith and Alexander are a lawyer and an MBA,
          respectively, so you should not read their book expecting
          great technical insights. The story of how so much
          innovation failed to become a winning product is sobering
          reading for anyone working in a corporate R&amp;D lab,
          though. The failure is particularly acute given that
          Xerox had previously completely transformed itself from
          Haloid Corporation, a small manufacturer of film, into
          the world's first copier company. Any product no matter
          how clever or innovative is a failure if no one buys it,
          and no technological wonder will make it to market
          without the cooperation of the men in suits.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm happy to see that <em>Fumbling the
          Future</em> is now back in print. There are still a
          lot of folks in Silicon Valley who would benefit by
          reading it. A lot of lip service is also paid to Clayton
          Christiansen's <em>The Innovator's Dilemman</em>,
          but the lessons these books have to teach have not yet
          been absorbed.

        <em>The First Salute</em> by <a href=
        "http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/tuchman.htm">Barbara
        Tuchman</a>
        <p>
          Having heard the same "Washington threw a dollar across
          the Delaware" stories for many years in public school, my
          eyes have always glazed over at the thought of the
          American Revolution. I read this book only since I trust
          Barbara Tuchman (author of <em>The Zimmerman
          Telegram</em>, about the start of WWI in the US;
          <em>The Guns of August</em>, about the start of
          WWI in Europe; <em>The Proud Tower</em>, about
          the rise of labor unions and socialism and the underlying
          causes of WWI; <em>The March of Folly</em>, a
          history of government incompetence; and <em>A Distant
          Mirror</em>, about the misery of the Plague and
          endless wars of succession in the 14th century). In fact
          Tuchman's book is a lively narrative of the War for
          Independence from the naval point of view. There are
          vivid accounts of the difficulty of firing a cannon at a
          distant warship on rolling seas and about the virtual
          piracy that was perpetrated by British Navy captains, who
          were allowed to keep a portion of the booty they captured
          during raids. I had not realized how vital the French
          Navy under Admiral deGrasse was to the American victory
          or how the Dutch West Indian islands kept the rebel
          effort alive by smuggling arms to the Colonies.
          Washington does turn out to be a remarkable hero: during
          the War, he did not visit home or see his wife for over
          six years.

        <em>Balkan Ghosts</em> by <a href=
        "http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/interviews/int2003-06-18.htm">
        Robert D. Kaplan</a>
        <p>
          I recommend this book with reservations. Kaplan does a
          good job of portraying the Balkans as a place where
          history is alive and ever-present, where a battle that
          occurred hundreds of years ago is constantly in the
          thoughts of today's residents. The conflicts are
          remarkable not only for their bitterness but for their
          variety: Serbians covet Kossovo, Macedonians covet
          Thessalonika, Rumanians covet parts of Ukraine, Greeks
          covet Macedonia and southern Albania, Hungarians covet
          Transylvania, and the list goes on and on. The phenomenon
          is "irredentism": each ethnic group wishes to control the
          territory it had conquered at the peak of its power
          during the last millenium. Mix in Ottoman, Nazi and
          Soviet tyranny and you have quite the recipe for unrest.
          Kaplan argues that only an increase in the regional
          standard of living will cause Balkan residents to think
          about the future rather than brooding about the glory of
          their past conquests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kaplan's coverage of the region is spotty. He traveled
          extensively in Rumania, and his musings about this
          country are both entertaining and informative. His
          chapter about Greece, on the other hand, is an
          anti-Papandreou diatribe, and his chapter about
          Yugoslavia is very unsatisfying. The Bulgaria chapter is
          halfway between, since Kaplan by his own admission got to
          know well only one Bulgarian, a journalist whose
          experience could have occurred in any Soviet satellite
          nation. He did not visit Albania at all. Throughout the
          book Kaplan frequently relates anecdotes about previous
          20th century journalists in the Balkans, which severely
          bored me. What I don't want to read in a travelogue is
          extensive quotation from other books! While I found
          <em>Balkan Ghosts</em> to be a worthwhile read,
          I'm still looking for the book that crystallizes the
          Balkan situation the way that <em>A Bright Shining
          Lie</em> and <em>Fire in the Lake</em>
          describe the <a href="vietnam.html">Vietnam War</a>.

          <em>From Beirut to Jerusalem</em> by <a href=
          "http://www.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/thomaslfriedman/">
          Thomas L. Friedman</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          During the 1980's, Thomas Friedman was first a
          correspondent in Lebanon and then one in Israel.
          Potential 21st-Century readers of <em>From Beirut to
          Jerusalem</em> might be put off by the book's
          original 1989 publication date, fearing that it is out of
          date. In fact I found it quite helpful in understanding
          today's headlines about the Intifada, peace negotiations,
          and the much discussed characters of Yasir Arafat and
          Ariel Sharon. Like <em>The Prize</em>, Friedman's
          work fairly bristles with fascinating anecdotes and
          snippets of history. Friedman shows great sympathy for
          all the participants, having befriended and lived among
          everyone from Druze to Lubavitchers to Maronites to Gush
          Emunim. The great strength of <em>From Beirut to
          Jerusalem</em> is its memoir form, where Friedman
          uses personal anecdotes to make these long-running
          conflicts come alive. He extensively quotes the words of
          participants and eyewitnesses, giving the book a real
          "you are there" flavor. A variety of mysteries are
          explained, including Israel's religious motivation for
          wishing to retain the West Bank, the conflict between
          Palestinians in the diaspora and Palestinians in the
          occupied territories, the controversy over immigration
          into Israel and the true story of the Sabra-Shatila
          massacre.

          <em>Between Bullets and Ballots: Algeria's Transition
          from Authoritarianism</em> by <a href=
          "http://www.brook.edu/scholars/wquand.htm">William B.
          Quandt</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          This book is for all of you who've been wondering, "What
          is the cause of all the grisly violence in Algeria?" All
          the pat explanations that have been applied to previous
          civil wars ("It's a religious conflict" or "It's an
          ethnic conflict") clearly did not apply in Algeria's
          case.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Between Bullets and Ballots</em> explains
          Algeria's violent present in terms of both its demography
          and the incompetence of its recent governments. Quandt
          makes a clear case that the failure of the French
          colonial government to incorporate Algerians or to allow
          formation of an educated Algerian elite left the newly
          independent state unprepared to govern itself. He
          convincingly argues that the authoritarian governments of
          the '70s and '80s muffed the transition to
          democratization that the oil price shocks of the period
          necessitated. Nonetheless Quandt ends on a note of
          optimism, arguing that Islam is not incompatible with
          democracy and that democratic governments have a bright
          if not trouble-free future in the Arab world.

          <em>Giant Molecules</em> by A.Yu. Grosberg and

          A.R. Khokhlov</a>

        <p>
          <em>Giant Molecules</em> is another fun-to-read,
          lighthearted monograph, this time about polymers and
          their role in biophysics. Enjoyment of this book requires
          little more than a knowledge of calculus, as the authors
          lead the reader through all the required concepts,
          including the clearest and best motivated derivation of
          the Second Law of Thermodynamics that I have read
          anywhere. The most fascinating sections deal with DNA and
          how the constraints of polymer replication and stability
          almost require genetic material to take the form it does.
          Polymer physics is much more unlike the rest of
          solid-state physics than I'd imagined, and the reason is
          that entropy as opposed to internal energy plays a
          dominant role. Because polymer chains have a lower
          entropy when they are uncoiled, elastic polymers tend to
          contract when heated!

        <em>Unraveling DNA: The Most Important Molecule of
        Life</em> by <a href=
        "http://bme.bu.edu/faculty/kamenetskii.html">Maxim D.
        Frank-Kamenetskii</a>
        <p>
          I picked up this book because the authors of
          <em>Giant Molecules</em> recommend it. Indeed
          <em>Unraveling DNA</em> is a good follow-up since
          it goes into much more detail about how the physical and
          chemical properties of the DNA molecule determine the
          biological results. As someone who last took a biology
          course in 1980, I particularly appreciated the fact that
          <em>Unraveling DNA</em> was written in 1993 and
          updated in 1997. Even two years is a long time in the
          history of molecular biology, a fact that is poignantly
          illustrated by <em>UD</em>'s hopeful comments
          about the AIDS "miracle" using "cocktails" of protease
          and reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Unraveling DNA</em> both traces the history
          of molecular biology and brings the reader up-to-date on
          such recent developments as the polymerase chain reaction
          and DNA sequencing. I was grateful for the plain-English
          descriptions of how these processes actually work. The
          author sketches the probable RNA origin of life,
          describes the variety of DNA-repair mechanisms employed
          by cells and details current efforts in cancer research.
          All this happens in a very readable 187 pages, including
          a number of explanatory diagrams. <em>Unraveling
          DNA</em> is one of a very few books that I have read
          twice all the way through.

        <em><a href=
        "http://www.microship.com/Adventures/Maggie/">Miles with
        Maggie</a></em> by Steven K. Roberts
        <p>
          Anyone who enjoyed Steven K. Roberts' <em>Computing
          Across America</em> should have a look at the sequel,
          <em>Miles with Maggie</em>. <em>MWM</em>
          is an <a href=
          "http://www.microship.com/Adventures/Maggie/">e-book</a>
          only. <em>CAA</em> described Roberts' decision to
          flee his secure suburban lifestyle and spend his days
          traveling around the country on a networked recumbent
          bike. Altogether he logged about 10,000 miles, had a slew
          of amusing adventures and slept with dozens of women. The
          book is as much as a description of Roberts' attempts to
          make a living at wish fulfillment as it is about cycling
          or computing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Miles with Maggie</em> picks up where
          <em>CAA</em> left off, describing Roberts'
          decision to build Winnebiko II, an upgraded version of
          his cybercycle. As the title suggests, he also took along
          a steady female companion who rode her own recumbent
          bicycle. They started out in Seattle, rode to the Bay
          Area, and then got stranded for a couple of years, as the
          bicycle building and riding became more of a business
          than a lifestyle. Nonetheless there are a number of
          entertaining and hair-raising anecdotes from the
          6000-mile roadtrip.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book ends at the point that Roberts is working on the
          BEHEMOTH project for which he is best known. Amusingly we
          learn by scanning the <a href=
          "http://www.microship.com/">Nomadics Research Lab</a>
          website that Roberts rode BEHEMOTH (the bicycle he
          exhibits at talks nowadays) only about 500 miles. Hence
          no BEHEMOTH book! The heroic 16,000 mile jaunt around
          America was accomplished not on the 780 pound BEHEMOTH
          but on the 280 pound Winnebiko II and the smaller
          Winnebiko. I get the impression reading
          <em>MWM</em> that Roberts lost his interest in
          travelling around the country on BEHEMOTH to his
          obsession for building it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I highly recommend these books to anyone who loves
          adventure travel, cycling or electrical engineering.
          Roberts' writing can sometimes be annoying: his
          descriptions of ecstatic sensory experiences are nearly
          always cloying. His social observations on the road are
          acute though, and his criticisms of American mall culture
          are right on the mark.

        <em>The Starship and The Canoe</em> by Kenneth
        Brower
        <p>
          At last, a book about paddle sports <em>and</em>
          physics! Kenneth Brower, son of the famous David, has
          written an account of the life of <a href=
          "http://www.annonline.com/interviews/971217/biography.html">
          George Dyson</a>, son of the famous Freeman and brother of
          the famous Esther. George turns out to be quite fascinating
          in his own right, and Brower's juxtaposition of Freeman's
          fantasies about space travel and George's true-life
          adventures on the waters of the Pacific Northwest is more
          apt than it might initially seem.  Brower uncovers the
          spirit of adventure that unites George's painstaking hand
          construction of a baidarka, a giant ocean-faring kayak, with
          Freeman's work on nuclear-propelled spacecraft.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The Starship and the Canoe</em> would be of
          interest to those who have enjoyed Roberts' travelogues.
          Both do a great job of capturing the unusual sense of
          community that is prevalent in nerd social circles.

        <em>Mexico's Copper Canyon Country: A Hiking and
        Backpacking Guide</em> by M. John Fayhee
        <p>
          At last, a book about hiking <em>and</em>
          beer-drinking! I haven't been to Copper Canyon yet, so I
          can't judge the utility of this trail guide at the
          vibram-meets-the-dirt level. I can tell you that this is
          by far the most entertaining hiking guide I have ever
          read, and I include the Colin Fletcher books in the
          comparison. Fayhee's book is very funny and includes
          plenty of fascinating details not only about the
          geography of the Copper Canyon area, but also about the
          culture of its inhabitants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other hiking guides I enthusiastically recommend are
          <em>Kauai Trails</em> by Kathy Morey and
          <em>100 Hikes in Southern Oregon</em> by William
          Sullivan. The wonderful cartoon maps in Sullivan's book
          are alone worth the purchase price. All competent trail
          guides give directions to the trailhead and tell how long
          the route is. The distinction between an indifferent
          guide and a great one is the author's ability to convey
          to the reader which hikes are the most enjoyable. For
          this reason, the best hiking guides are fun to sit and
          read even when a trip is not imminent. Morey and
          Sullivan's books are both excellent in this regard. With
          Fayhee, you not only want to go on the backpacks he
          recommends, you'd like him to accompany you.

        <em>Give Us Credit: How Muhammad Yunus's Micro-Lending
        Revolution is Empowering Women from Bangladesh to
        Chicago</em> by Alex Counts
        <p>
          Alex Counts vividly tells us the many stories behind the
          founding and continuing success of <a href=
          "http://www.grameen-info.org/">Grameen Bank</a>, the home
          of the world micro-lending movement. Micro-lending is
          based on the realization that what the poor need to lift
          them out of poverty is often not a handout, but a small
          amount of credit (perhaps $100) and some well-organized
          encouragement. If ever an approach sounded simplistic and
          utopian, it's Grameen's. What makes Grameen worthy of
          extended consideration is its impressive success, not
          only in its base in Pakistan, but in duplicate programs
          all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Counts' book is not a dry economics lesson, but an
          engrossing history of Grameen and the leaders who have
          sacrificed to make it work. He tells the touching stories
          of Grameen borrowers both in Pakistan and in Chicago and
          relates hows the changes wrought by the tiny amounts of
          money made available have rippled through the local
          society. I found this book to a great eye-opener; I could
          never have imagined before how important a flea market
          might be to women struggling to become self-employed, nor
          could I have imagined how resourceful and creative the
          very poor could be in starting their own businesses.
          Yunus convinces us that the main problems with povery
          alleviation programs often lie not with the supposed
          indolence of the poor but with the lack of imagination
          that donors exhibit.

        <em>The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in
        the West and Fails Everywhere Else</em> by Hernando de
        Soto
        <p>
          <em>The Mystery of Capital</em> is a treatise
          about the economic effects of bad legal systems. Ugh or
          perhaps eeew, are my initial reactions to this topic, but
          the engaging writing and curiosity about the question
          raised by the title kept me reading. Like Muhammad Yunus,
          de Soto believes that useful assistance to Third World
          poor is possible, but that current aid efforts are
          misdirected. He identifies an antiquated system of
          permits and property as the main obstacle to progress in
          developing countries. de Soto argues persuasively that
          the large size of the underground "extralegal" economy in
          Third World and former Communist countries is due to the
          near impossibility of working inside these nations'
          labyrinthine legal systems. He claims that reform of
          property laws would allow poor enterpreneurs full access
          to capital, advertising, and economies of scale, and thus
          would finally make capitalism work in countries where it
          has to date produced only more misery. de Soto, the
          author, is president of Peru's <a href=
          "http://www.ild.org.pe">Institute for Liberation and
          Democracy</a> and is a persuasive author.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to Howie Jackson of the University of Cincinnati
          for recommending this book and for pointing out that de
          Soto's ideas about "virtual money" and the fungibility of
          capital have implications for e-commerce as well as Third
          World development.

          <em>The Curious Cook: More Kitchen Science and
          Lore</em> by <a href=
          "http://www.curiouscook.com/">Harold McGee</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The Curious Cook</em> is not a science text
          but it would make a thoughtful gift for any scientist who
          likes to mess around in the kitchen. McGee's book does
          contain some useful information about how to prepare
          food, but most of the writing is devoted instead to the
          chemistry of cooking. McGee's simple experiments with
          food will charm both scientists and small children.
          (Okay, perhaps this conjunction is not terribly
          surprising!) Particularly diverting are an explanation of
          sherbert-making in terms of the entropy of mixing and a
          discussion of steak-grilling in terms of Fick's Law.
          Nonetheless McGee's prose is completely jargon-free and
          will entertain anyone who suspected all along that
          mushrooms don't really absorb water.

          <em>The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us
          to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?</em> by
          <a href="http://www.davidbrin.com">David Brin</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          David Brin asks what outcome the unstoppable advance of
          surveillance technologies will have and answers
          optimistically that life may improve. Brin is a
          well-informed curmudgeon who argues fairly convincingly
          that technologies may improve public safety <em>and</em>
          expand democratic freedoms -- as long as they are applied
          in a symmetric way, where average citizens have as much
          power to monitor as corporations and governments. He
          offers a myriad of examples to support his point of view,
          from whistleblowers to the police brutality videotapes of
          the last decade. Sometimes the book includes too many
          examples and supporting quotations, seeming more like a
          set of notes for a book on openness than a finished text.
          Brin's critique of "strong privacy" advocates and their
          support of cryptographic schemes is particularly
          on-target, as he chides the cypherpunks to recall that
          electronic communication is only a small part of privacy,
          and corporate snoops are at least as dangerous as the
          government. While <em>The Transparent
          Society</em> can be annoyingly chatty, it is a fast
          read and leaves the reader with much to consider. Brin's
          arguments are a valuable addition to the post-9/11
          national dialogue about the tension between security and
          the Bill of Rights.

          <em>The Anarchist in the Library: How the Clash
          between Freedom and Control is Hacking the Real World and
          Crashing the System</em> by <a href=
          "http://www.sivacracy.net/">Siva Vaidhyanathan</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you've been following the culture war that pits the MPAA,
          Microsoft and Cary Sherman against BitTorrent, Linux and
          Phil Zimmerman, then you probably think that there can't
          possibly be anything fresh to say on the topic.  Siva
          Vaidhyanathan proves this supposition wrong by grounding his
          discussion of oligarchy-versus-anarchy in the context of
          European history. He sees the tensions over encryption and
          peer-to-peer technologies as the latest chapter in a long
          struggle. The most important new twist of the battle is not
          technological. Rather what has changed is that governments
          are now acting on behalf of corporations and
          copyright-holders rather than in favor of hereditary
          elites. In fact Vaidhyanathan decries the search for
          technological solutions to the day's controversies, arguing
          that a lasting consensus can only through a serious societal
          discussion of what's at stake -- personal freedoms, artistic
          expression, the ability of cultures to grow and
          change. Vaidhyanathan's discussion of the open-source and
          anti-globalization movements in terms of the historical
          anarchistic "leaderless resistance" movements is
          particularly provocative. I had never considered before that
          the development of a usable e-book may lead to a
          pay-per-view model for reading and inevitably corporate
          pressure to close public libraries.  Nonetheless the book's
          greatest strength is in its balanced, reasonable
          presentation of the issues although it veers a bit left
          during the discussion of globalization. (I don't agree that
          Mexico is more democratic than the US!)

      <li><p><em>The Secret Life of Dust: From the Cosmos to the
      Kitchen Counter, the Big Consequences of Little Things</em>
      by Hannah Holmes</p>
      <p>
      Holmes' story begins with astronomical dust and the creation of
      the planets, moves on to dust in geology and agriculture, and
      finishes strongly with a discussion of dust in medicine.  The
      chapters on the varied topics don't have that much to do with
      one another, and the book could be read out of order without any
      great loss in comprehensibility.  Nonetheless Holmes' writing is
      chatty and engaging, and she goes out of her way to make the
      science appealing and accessible to the general reader.  Holmes'
      findings about the toxicity of household dust will make you want
      to take up your carpet, and the story of the transport of
      topsoil around the world is fascinating.  I wouldn't have
      thought of dust as a cross-cutting topic of broad scientific
      interest but Holmes makes a strong case.

      <li><p><em>Ultimate Fitness: The Quest for Truth About
      Exercise and Health</em> by Gina Kolata</p>
      <p>Gina Kolata began her career as a reporter for <a
      href="http://www.sciencemag.org/">Science</a> and continues to
      cover health-related topics at the <a
      href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/science/index.html">N.Y.
      Times</a>.  She has a rare ability to turn a collection of
      quotations from scholarly authorities into a readable,
      informative piece of reportage so I was pleased to see that she
      had written a book purporting to get to the bottom of exercise
      myths.  <em>Ultimate Fitness</em> is essentially a collection of
      interviews with exercise pioneers and fitness quacks plus an
      account of Kolata's own obsession with <a
      href="http://www.spinning.com/">Spinning</a>, a semi-masochistic
      workout plan based on stationary bicycles.  The author does a
      great job of deflating stupid myths like the idea that there is
      a "fat-burning" heart-rate range.  Naturally the concept is a
      misunderstanding of scientific data and a higher heart rate
      leads to more calorie consumption as any reasonable person would
      expect.  Unfortunately after a few chapters the reality begins
      to sink in that <em>Ultimate Fitness</em> is much more of a long
      <em>N.Y. Times</em> piece than the synthesis of the scientific
      literature that readers will have been hoping for. Kolata's
      discussion of the psychology of exercise devotees proves to be
      the most satisfying portion of <em>Ultimate Fitness</em>.  In a
      book generally light on conclusions, she observes that good
      physical condition may be more of a sign of mental health than a
      predictor of longevity.  (If you're looking for a book about how
      to become fit, I recommend instead the <a
      href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0788173626/qid=1125971041/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-3091338-8775018?v=glance">Navy

      <p><a name="drones"><em>Attack of the Drones: A History of Unmanned Aerial
      Combat</em></a> by Bill Yenne
      </p>
      <p>I expected that <em>Attack of the Drones</em> would
      offer up-to-date information about the Predator, Global Hawk and
      <a
      href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/ucav.htm">UCAV</a>
      (unmanned combat air vehicle) programs.  What I didn't expect
      was Yenne's lively, witty writing, an ingredient that is often
      missing in the type of instant book I expected <em>Attack of
      the Drones</em> to be.  So while I purchased this book for
      the fine collection of UAV photos, I was pleased to get a
      readable and informative text.  The early history of the UAV
      program is quite interesting, with Teledyne Ryan Firebee drones
      having been used all the way back in Vietnam days to scout out
      enemy SAM sites.  Yenne relates the fascinating story of many
      UAVs that never made it to production like stealth models and a
      variety of helicopters.  As would be expected, the more recent
      and successful UAVs are covered in some detail and the
      presentation has enough technical information and specifications
      to satisfy most readers' curiosity.  (For example, why do UAVs
      usually have pusher props in the rear?  Because net recovery may
      occasionally be useful even if runway landings are the normal
      plan.)  Yenne includes considerable material about the planned
      UAVs of the future and profiles the pioneers of the UAV
      movement, Hollywood actor Reginald Denny and Firebee originator
      Claude Ryan.  Foreign UAV programs are passed over a bit quickly
      and unfortunately there's not one word in the whole book about
      cost (the deepest secret of all).  Nonetheless <em>Attack of
      the Drones</em> is strongly recommended to anyone curious
      about UAVs.  I will be looking for the prolific Yenne's other
      books, including <em>Beers of North America</em> (!).

      <p><em>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</em> by <a
      href="http://www.princeton.edu/~bmalkiel/">Burton Malkiel</a>
      </p>
      <p><em>A Random Walk</em> is guru Malkiel's classic work
      about investing, now in its eighth edition.  Malkiel's knowledge
      is encyclopedic but his advice is so common-sensical, it's hard
      to see why more investors don't heed it.  The book's main thesis
      is that the market is efficient, meaning that short of having
      illegal inside knowledge to trade on, individuals are unlikely
      to do better by purchasing individual stocks than by investing
      in index funds.  Malkiel also emphasizes that short-term
      fluctuations of the market are random (1/f noise presumably) and
      that "technical" analyses that subject stock price data to
      statistical scrutiny are extremely unlikely to make money once
      transaction costs are taken into account.  Fittingly then,
      Malkiel is one of the founders of <a
      href="http://www.vanguard.com/">Vanguard</a>, from which he has
      recently (2005) <a
      href="http://flagship4.vanguard.com/VGApp/hnw/VanguardViewsArticle?ArticleJSP=/freshness/News_and_Views/news_ALL_director_08082005_ALL.jsp">retired.</a>
      </p>
      <p>The biggest surprise about <em>A Random Walk</em> is what a
      lively read it is.  Malkiel is not a prose stylist but his text
      is full of amusing anecdotes and he's not afraid to name names
      in either praise or derision.  I regret a bit reading the 1996
      edition (from the library) not because I think his advice has
      changed but because I'm curious what Malkiel would have to say
      about Blodget and Grubman.  Who knew that there had been a tech
      stock craze before, in 1959-1962?  The real value of the book
      lies in its explanations of both the simple (buy index funds)
      and the baroque (why options purchases can be insurance for the
      conservative investor rather than a vehicle for speculation).

      Life of Lobsters</a></em> by Trevor Corson
      </p>
      <p>Trevor Corson artfully intersperses essays about the biology
      of lobsters with humorous and touching anecdotes about the
      scientists who study them and the fishermen who capture them.
      While the details of the lobsters' behavior and life cycle are
      fascinating in their own right, the author's portraits of the
      fisherman and scientists struggling to understand and preserve
      the lobster fishery are the heart of the book.  Corson spent two
      years as a sternman on a fishing boat and clearly knows his
      material well.  He also spent weeks interviewing lobster
      biologists, many of whom leave the laboratory to don waders or
      scuba gear or even visit the benthic realms in submersibles.
      Like <a href="#mcphee">John McPhee</a>, Corson has a talent for
      presenting complex technical issues in an accessible and
      entertaing way.  Since Corson is a lot younger than McPhee, we
      can look forward to reading his work for many years.

      <li><p><em>Flow: the Psychology of Optimal Experience</em> by <a
      href="http://www.cgu.edu/pages/1871.asp">Mihaly
      Csikszentmihalyi</a></p>

      <p><em>Flow</em> has been recommended to me repeatedly over the
      years and I've finally gotten around to reading it.
      Prof. Csikszentmihalyi makes the distinction between pleasure,
      which involves a satiation of the senses, and enjoyment, which
      is the satisfaction that derives from mastering challenges.  The
      essence of his argument is that modern humans expend too many of
      their waking hours in dull, dissipative experiences like
      watching television, which hardly even provides pleasure.  What
      we need instead are engrossing hobbies and work tasks that make
      us forget ourselves.  The primary purpose of distractions is to
      shut up the voice of anxiety in our heads, he argues, but such
      distractions do not make us happy.</p>

      <p>Much of what Csikszentmihalyi writes is undeniably true and
      his arguments are less original than they are clear and
      forceful.  Robert Pirsig spoke more eloquently on the same
      subject in <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>
      over 20 years ago.  <em>Flow</em> gets more stimulating when the
      author argues that a short attention span and lack of mental
      discipline are the primary causes of the restlessness that most
      people feel.  There are inspiring anecdotes about survivors of
      calamities who have, through tremendous mental discipline, put
      them out of their minds.  However Csikszentmihalyi offers little
      practical advice as to how an ordinary person might develop such
      discipline beyond finding an engrossing hobby and pouring energy
      into it.  As with many self-help books, the reader gets the
      feeling that <em>Flow</em> is a fascinating magazine article
      which has been expanded into a rather wordy book.
