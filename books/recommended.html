        <p><em>Disturbing the Universe</em> by <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson">Freeman
        Dyson</a>
	</p>Of all the many accounts of 20th century physics I've
	read, Dyson's has to be my favorite.  As the title indicates,
	<em>Disturbing the Universe</em> has to be the only
	physics memoir to extensively quote <a
	href="fict.html#eliot">T.S. Eliot.</a> Dyson's presence at
	remarkably many of the major events of the last fifty years is
	what makes his memoir worth such compelling reading.  Dyson
	not only did seminal work on quantum electrodynamics, he also
	had original ideas about space colonization, nuclear power and
	arms control.  Somehow he even had time to advise Stanley
	Kubrick about <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>.  What
	really sets <em>Disturbing the Universe</em> apart is
	its moral clarity.  Before undertaking a science career, he
	analyzed statistics about the WWII British bombing campaign
	and managed at the height of "the last good war" to see the
	folly and evil behind the strategy of targeting civilians.
	Dyson's strong sense of ethics infuses his portraits of
	Oppenheimer, Feynman, and Teller, whom he knew well but does
	not judge.  Charmingly, Dyson is not afraid to run the numbers
	about any arbitrarily wild-eyed idea.  His comparative cost
	analysis of the Pilgrim expedition to America, the Mormon
	journey to Utah and the voyage of space colonists to the
	asteroids is the highlight of this very entertaining and
	thought-provoking work.  </li>

          Carver Mead, <em>Collective Electrodynamics: Quantum
          Foundations of Electromagnetism</em>
        </p>      
	<p>
	In <em>Collective Electrodynamics</em>,
        <a href="http://www.pcmp.caltech.edu/">Carver Mead</a> is
        out to convince the physics community that the
        electromagnetic vector and scalar potentials are more
        fundamental than the electric and magnetic fields. In
        addition, he supports the wave picture of electromagnetic
        interactions as being more fundamental than the particle
        view, and he endorses Einstein's criticisms of Bohr's
        (non-)interpretation of quantum mechanics. None of this
        would be worth mentioning except that Mead's arguments are
        fairly convincing, as he shows that his methods give the
        correct answers to well-known problems, and the
        non-existence of particles and fields eliminates any
        problems with infinite self-energies. Electromagnetic
        interactions are confusing when viewed from the point of
        view of the exchange of photons, he says, and simple when
        viewed as the accumulation of phase of electron
        wavefunctions. "The potentials A and V are not degrees of
        freedom on their own -- they are, as their name implies,
        the <em>potential for interaction</em> of the collective
        degrees of freedom of the electron system," he writes.
        Another fascinating section explains how the collective
        motion of electrons carries the energy and momentum
        typically ascribed to the electromagnetic fields. Even more
        interestingly, Mead introduces the "transactional" view of
        quantum mechanics in describing how a correct treatment of
        the problem of radiation damping leads inevitably to the
        conclusion that causality is a statistical property of the
        universe, not a fundamental law. Mead introduces the
        electrodynamic theory of Feynman and Wheeler, which treated
        advanced and retarded potentials on an equal footing, and
        which concluded that "if there were only a few chunks of
        matter in the universe . . . the future would, indeed,
        affect the past." To follow this fascinating discussion,
        the only prerequisites are an understanding of simple
        calculus and a vague recollection of undergraduate-level
        electrodynamics. After finishing <em>Collective
        Electrodynamics</em>, I'm anxious to read
        <em>Time's Arrow Today</em>, <em>Cosmology and
        Action at a Distance Electrodynamics</em> by Hoyle and
        Narlikar, and <em>Schodinger's Kittens and the Search
        for Reality</em> by John Gribbin.

          Read an interview</a> with Mead about <em>Collective
          Electrodynamics</em> on the <em>American
          Spectator</em> website. Despite an introduction full
          of outrageous and ill-informed bombast ("Perhaps more
          than any other man, Mead has spent his professional life
          working on intimate terms with matter at the atomic and
          subatomic levels"), the interview itself is worth
          reading. (Thanks to David Haddon for the tip.) Mead's
          comments may make you consider whether Bohr's
          Correspondence Principle isn't after all a cultural
          construct, in keeping with the spirit of the times in the
          '20s and '30s.

          "http://www.gac.edu/nobel/1995/degennes.html">Pierre-Gilles
          de Gennes'</a> new book <em>Fragile Objects</em> is
          rather small in format and has reasonably large type so that
          when I received it I thought, "For this I paid $24?"  My
          first impression was wrong.  Not only does the book contain
          an entertaining exposition of the physics of polymers, gels,
          foams, surfactants and colloids at a beginning undergraduate
          level, but it also offers some thoughtful reminiscences by
          de Gennes on his career. It's inspiring to read the frank
          thoughts of a scientist who has not only revolutionized the
          fields he worked in, but to some extent has pioneered
          them. de Gennes offers practical advice on how to change
          scientific fields, deplores the overreliance of young
          scientists on fancy equipment, stingingly criticizes the way
          science is taught, and exhorts scientists to leave the ivory
          tower and work on problems of real societal
          significance. The book is a fast read and an entertaining
          one as well. (By the way, does anyone know whether Ettore
          Majorana really disappeared?) I'm looking forward to reading
          de Gennes' other <a href= "http://www.springer.de/">Springer

          Engelbert Broda, <em>Ludwig Boltzmann: Man -- Physicist
          -- Philosopher</em>
        </p>
	<p>
         Broda's brief but entertaining biography of Ludwig Boltzmann
         is an easy if somewhat unsatisfying read. Touching and funny
         tales about Boltzmann's life are interspersed with
         fascinating anecdotes about the birth of statistical
         mechanics. Unfortunately the book also has long excerpts from
         Boltzmann's writings about epistemology, which is not what he
         is remembered for, to say the least. We learn of Boltzmann's
         job-hopping before his mysterious suicide at age 62 in 1906.
         Popularly it has always been supposed that the cause of
         Boltzmann's despair was the advent of quantum mechanics and
         relativity, but this work shows that belief to be incorrect.
         It seems almost incredible in 2002, but it was Mach's and
         Ostwald's attacks on the reality of atoms that most upset
         Boltzmann.

          Russell McCormmach, <em>Night thoughts of a

          University Press, 1982.
        </p>
        <p>
          McCormmach's book is a fictionalized autobiography of
          Ludwig Boltzmann, whose work was unappreciated in his
          lifetime and who eventually committed suicide. This book
          is much more entertaining than that description would
          suggest. Some of the academia jokes are worthy of David
          Lodge.

          Jagdish Mehra, <em>The Beat of a Different Drum: The
          life and science of Richard Feynman</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Jagdish Mehra's <em>The Beat of a Different Drum: The
          life and science of Richard Feynman</em> is an
          excellent review of Feynman's personal and professional
          life, far outclassing Gleick's depressing opus
          <em>Genius</em>, which added little that was new
          IMHO. Mehra's book is much better than the title, which
          reminds me of that horrid Linda Ronstadt song. It traces
          the development of Feynman's thinking on matters like the
          path integral in a way that I (who never took a course in
          field theory) can understand. Mehra's book is not for
          those who want to read more <em>Surely You're
          Joking</em> types of anecdotes; it's a serious
          biography.

        </p>
        <p>
          N.P. Davis' <em>Lawrence and Oppenheimer</em> is
          a vivid portrait of two very different men: Lawrence the
          narrow-minded hick who was the first big-instrument
          physicist, and Oppenheimer the self-destructive dreamer
          who nonetheless managed to run the Manhattan Project. A
          fairly light read with new (to me) info about the history
          of postwar research funding.

        </p>
        <p>
          Segre's histories of modern and classical physics are
          full of interesting personalities and anecdotes about how
          they made their discoveries. There's much more here than
          you will find in Halliday and Resnick or some other dry
          tome. These books are also easy to read. A particularly
          fascinating character is Michael Faraday, the
          bookbinder's apprentice who learned by reading the books.
          Faraday invented the motor and the transformer,
          discovered benzene and pioneered electrochemistry and
          field theory.

          Pais' history of postwar physics explains to us condensed

          info is interesting. I tried to read Pais' book on
          Einstein, but couldn't stand it. I'm just too bored with
          Einstein legends to consume a whole book. The only
          anecdote I remember from <em>Inward Bound</em>
          was about Rutherford. Evidently he was out in his
          family's garden in New Zealand digging potatoes when the
          news came by mail that he'd been admitted to Manchester
          University . Evidently he threw down his trowel and

        <p>
          Regis' book is a bit too frothy for my taste; the

        <p>
          Goudsmit's book is about the US intelligence effort to track

          war. <em>Alsos</em> is truly poorly written, but
          contains fascinating tales of famous physics personalities.
          When the German bomb scientists, infamously led by
          Heisenberg, heard that the US had exploded a nuclear weapon,
          they didn't believe it! They couldn't conceive that their
          students, who had fled to the US, had made something work
          which they could not.

          Rhodes' story of the Manhattan project is probably the best

          <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em> is
          chock-a-block with amusing anecdotes of the bomb projects
          and fascinating technical detail. If anyone knows a better

          and more to Oppenheimer than previous sources I have read
          (see below). This volume contains much political and
          technical detail about how decisions regarding The Bomb were

          <em>The Enigma</em> is a fine portrait of a

          genius, and the pathos of his life is sure to sadden any
          sympathetic reader, even those who are straight.
          <em>The Enigma</em> is a bit long, and the
          extended metaphors (referring to Turing as Alice, etc.)
          get a bit irritating, but all in all it is a good read.

        <p>
          <em>The Physicists</em> was a bit a disappointing
          to me. There is good coverage of the beginnings of
          physics in the US with Michelson, Henry and Gibbs. In
          addition the history of radar development at MIT durring
          WWII and the development of sonar at New London during
          WWI are given a thorough treatment. Many physics history
          books gloss over these non-nuclear military developments
          in a rush to treat the more glamorous Manhattan project
          in excessive detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately much of the rest of the book is about the
          National Academy of Sciences, the National Research Council,
          and, in laborious detail, the prehistory of the National
          Science Foundation. I would much rather have read more about
          the founding of the <a href="http://www.aps.org/">American
          Physical Society</a> and the <em>Physical
          Review</em> (which are given short shrift) than learn so
          much about the National Academy, which seems less
          significant in the history of physics. In general Kevles'
          book gives a lot of attention to statistics and
          Congressional actions and much less to the development of
          the culture and institutions of US physics.

          Gusterson</a>, <em>Nuclear Rites: A Weapons
          Laboratory at the End of the Cold War</em>,
          University of California Press, 1996.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Nuclear Rites</em> is an anthropologist's
          view of two competing tribes, namely nuclear weapons
          scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Bay
          Area antinuclear activists who oppose the Lab's work.
          Rather than argue about which side is right, Gusterson
          instead investigates the question of how two groups of
          mostly middle-class, well-educated people could come to
          such fervently held and bitterly opposed beliefs. Through
          extensive interviews Gusterson learns how Lab employees
          could rationalize working on weapons of mass destruction
          and why protestors were willing to disrupt their lives by
          being arrested in "direct action" demonstrations. This
          unusual approach to the controversy is quite
          illuminating, and would serve well those who wish to
          understand other unending debates, such the battles over
          abortion or gun control.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find many "science studies" books unbearable when they
          waste energy claiming that scientists' models and
          theories are elaborate social constructions rather than
          sensible responses to experimentally observed facts.
          Refreshingly, Gusterson eschews this viewpoint, being
          more interested in how weapons scientists think about the
          unthinkable. As he says, "Indeed, it would seem to me to
          be almost grotesquely irrelevant and scholastic to argue
          that the scientific principles of weapons designs are
          social constructions . . . when the weapons' ability to
          wipe out entire nations has already been experimentally
          demonstrated on two cities . . . ." Yes, "grotesquely
          irrelevant and scholastic" is a perfect description of
          the humanities' critique of science, particularly that
          put forward by feminists. <em>Nuclear Rites</em>
          is an accomplishment in that it puts aside such falderal
          and approaches the weapons scientists (and protestors)
          with an open mind.

        </p>
        <p>
          Doesn't someone out there want to write a <a href=
          "http://www.pbs.org/tesla/">decent Tesla biography?</a> Both
          these books are disappointing. The Wise book is so clunky
          and stilted that I simply couldn't finish it. Cheney's book
          is full of ridiculous claims (Tesla inspired the synchroton,
          Tesla invented the electron microscope, etc.) and pure
          anti-science BS (Tesla had precognition, Tesla's work
          explains Kirlian photography, etc.). While Tesla was
          obviously a shameless self-promoter, <em>Man out of
          Time</em> demeans his memory by obscuring his real and
          undeniable engineering contributions. Cheney implicitly
          endorses the completely nonsensical idea that Tesla invented
          beam weapons and broadcast power devices whose designs have
          been suppressed by the Military-Industrial Complex and have
          not been independently rediscovered. The author's poor
          judgement is all the more frustrating since she has clearly
          done a huge amount of research on Tesla's personal and
          professional life.  Tesla is arguably the inventor of the
          brushless ac motor, the transformer, the electrical power
          grid, remote control, fluorescent lighting and radio, and he
          deserves a far better biography than either of these two
          books. Remarkably the <a href="http://www.aps.org/">American

      <p>Winchester's book tells the little known but important story
      of William Smith, the first geologist to realize the importance
      of fossils for dating and ordering strata of rock.  Smith was a
      British working-class civil engineer whose fascination with
      fossils led him to found the science of stratigraphy.
      Winchester's narrative focuses on the difficulty that Smith had
      in getting credit for his ideas and his struggles with financial
      insolvency.  While Smith is an appealing character, the book is
      poorly organized and repetitive.  Readers will find themselves
      wondering, "Didn't anyone edit this manuscript?"  While I'm glad
      to have read <em>The Map that Changed the World,</em> Smith like
      Tesla deserves a better biographer.

    <p><a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/~rgoldste/">Rebecca
    Goldstein</a>, <em>Properties of Light</em>
    </p>
    <p>Goldstein's novel will remind theatergoers of <a
    href="http://www.maa.org/features/proof.html">David Auburn's</a>
    recent <em>Proof</em> as both works feature the basic plot of a
    graduate student courting the daughter of a mad-genius
    professor-father.  The academic subject matter of <em>Properties
    of Light</em> is alternative theories of quantum mechanics rather
    than number theory.  Assuredly these are both subjects that have
    proven altogether too fascinating for many too smart people.
    Goldstein's protagonists are Samuel Mallach, a washed-up and
    obscure professor, and Justin Childs, a young theoretical physics
    hotshot.  Unfortunately the tale of Justin's collaboration with
    Samuel and romance with Samuel's daughter Dana is rather bloodless
    compared to Auburn's hot-tempered play.  In an unfortunate
    afterword, Goldstein informs readers that the reviled
    Prof. Mallach was based on the well known physicist David Bohm.
    Goldstein appears not to understand that the unpopularity of local
    hidden-variables theories derives from their inability to make
    testable predictions.  In fact, the <a
    href="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/eric.chopin/epr/bell.htm">Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
    paradox</a> and the Bell Inequalities continue to be lively
    subjects for discussion in physics circles.

    Goldstein,</a> <em>Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt
    G&#246;del</em>
    </p>
    <p>This extended essay by the same author on the life and work of
    Kurt G&#246;del is far more engrossing.  G&#246;del's work raises
    the provocative and even disturbing question of how we can know
    that assertions are true if we can't prove them.  Readers can
    decide for themselves whether they are post-modern positivists
    like Ludwig Wittgenstein, who believe that numbers are human
    constructions, or hard-headed platonists like G&#246;del, who
    believe that mathematical truths await our discovery of them.
    G&#246;del is contrasted not only with his contemporary and fellow
    Austrian Wittgenstein but with his friend and Institute for
    Advanced Study co-worker Einstein.  The self-referential nature of
    G&#246;del's landmark incompleteness proof is sketched so that
    laypeople can understand it.  Simultaneously Goldstein gives us a
    portrait of the withdrawn and alienated man that G&#246;del was.
    Mathematicians and philosophers have apparently criticized
    Goldstein's book as superficial but I enjoyed it immensely, coming
    as I do to the topic as I did with little previous knowledge.  The
    text goes way beyond what a reader will glean from the amazing but
    more lightweight <em>G&#246;del, Escher, Bach</em>.

    Sellars</a>, <a name="dratomic"><em>Dr. Atomic</em></a>
    </p>
    <p>Readers of the books recommended here will agree that the story
    of the development of the atomic bomb is truly operatic in its
    scope and conflict.  Drama abounds in the post-war struggle
    between Teller and Oppenheimer or in the Japanese cabinet's
    post-Nagasaki tie vote on surrender.  Oppenheimer was a remarkable
    man whose extramarital affairs and Communist friends (Haakon
    Chevalier and his brother Frank) greatly complicated his life.
    While the work went on at Trinity, Feynman's youthful love Arline
    lay dying of tuberculosis and Klaus Fuchs was plotting the
    treachery that would later take the lives of the Rosenbergs.  All
    this melodrama is perfect for an opera, yet none of it is
    presented in <em>Dr. Atomic</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Peter Sellars, the librettist and director of
    <em>Dr. Atomic</em>, instead presents the audience with snatches
    of Muriel Rukeyser poetry and Native American songs.  Rather than
    have the main characters pantomime the drama, viewers are
    consigned to watch a dozen dancers twitch about to Adams' brooding
    music.  While the plot does deal with the inner conflicts of the
    few historical characters on stage (Gen. Leslie Groves,
    Oppenheimer, Teller and Robert Wilson), the interaction between
    them takes up little of the running time.  A stunning soliliquy by
    the Oppenheimer character at the end of the first act that is
    based on a poem by John Donne is a rare high point in a
    performance which has more weather jokes than consideration of the
    morality of weapons use.
    </p>
    <p>As presented at San Francisco's Opera House,
    <em>Dr. Atomic</em> had a dynamic set that suggested an industrial
    site.  The evocative lighting showed the distant Sangre de Cristo
    mountains in flashes of lightning.  The Bomb mockup that hung over
    the center of the stage for most of the performance had all the
    menace that its creator intended.  Most of this cleverness is
    wasted on the minimal recounting of the Trinity story.  In the end
    I had the impression that Sellars' determination to create large
    roles for female singers distorted his choice of material to the
    point that the second act is hardly about the Bomb at all.

    <p>Bob Buderi, <em>The Invention that Changed the
    World: How a small group of radar pioneers won the Second World
    War and launched a technical revolution</em>
    </p>
    <p>The disparity between the amount written about the development
    of atomic weapons compared to the attention paid to the history of
    radar is striking.  Buderi's book is an attempt to rectify the
    imbalance by taking a detailed look at radar's development, with a
    special emphasis on the work done at the MIT Radiation Lab.  The
    tome starts with the invention of the cavity magnetron at the
    University of Birmingham and follows with a blow-by-blow account
    of radar's development and utilization during World War II.  As
    with many such works, the narrative suffers from the introduction
    of too many characters and acronyms for a reader to keep track.
    The technical level is strangely mixed, with some concepts
    explained at an introductory level while other jargon and acronyms
    are tossed off without explanation.  While the reader may have to
    page back and forth and use the index to refresh his/her memory of
    who's who, Buderi's book is reasonably easy and entertaining to
    read.  His tales about the desperation of the Battle of Britain,
    the cleverness of engineers trying to piece together information
    about Germany's radar network and the intermittent
    British-American rivalry can't help but be compelling.  As with
    the Manhattan Project, readers will find inspiring the tale of how
    much a laboratory can accomplish when highly motivated and
    talented people are all pulling together.
    </p>
    <p>The second half of the book is about how WWII veterans utilized
    the new microwave technology to make major advances in magnetic
    resonance spectroscopy, silicon devices, masers and lasers, early
    warning radars and radioastronomy.  Some of the stories (notably
    that of the transistor) have been better told before but Buderi's
    account is still worth reading.  The second half is less sprawling
    than the first, as the individual technologies are treated in
    self-contained chapters which are tidier than the intrinsically
    unmanageable story of WWII.  Buderi has been editor of <a
    href="http://www.technologyreview.com/">Technology Review</a> and
    some of the MIT-related content appears to be derived from
    articles that previously appeared in MIT publications.
    Nonetheless the stories of the founding of Lincoln Lab, MITRE, the
    High-Voltage Engineering Corporation and the Research Laboratory
    of Electronics will interest non-alumni as well.

    </p>
    <p>While <em>Building Scientific Apparatus</em> is not a
    scientific biography or memoir, it is far and away the most useful
    job-related book I own.  I consult it nearly every day and could
    really use three copies, one for my cubicle, one for my lab and
    one to leave at home.  The book is encyclopedic, covering topics
    in electronics, optics and mechanical design in exhaustive detail.
    The text is also very pedagogical, clearly explaining the
    principles behind rules of thumb and illustrating concepts with
    simple diagrams and worked examples.  While various specialized
    areas like fiber optics, vacuum system construction, cryogenics
    and statistical data analysis are covered in more detail in other
    works, <em>Building Scientific Apparatus</em> remains the best
    one-volume place for finding how-to information.  The section on
    digital electronics and computer interfacing in the version I own
    is fairly dated, but I see that there's a new 2002 edition.  The
    book is packed with enough interesting trivia that you can
    entertain yourself by flipping through it randomly.
