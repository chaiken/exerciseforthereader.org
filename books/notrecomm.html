      Capsule Reviews of Some Books I Don't Recommend
    </h1>
    <p>The shelves are full of bad books; why single these volumes out
    for criticism?  The highly praised, smug, pretentious failure is
    far more annoying than the lowly Harlequin romance which purports
    to be nothing more than entertainment.

      <strong>Classics I Hate</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the point of <strong>Dubliners</strong>? Wasn't
      <strong>Lolita</strong> incredibly dull and hard to finish?
      Did anyone really find <strong>Turn of the Screw</strong> to
      be scary? I read only one page of <strong>Angela's
      Ashes</strong> and felt totally unenthusiastic about the very
      dated <strong>Catcher in the Rye</strong>. I don't understand
      what people see in Nadine Gordimer or Joyce Carol Oates
      either. Weren't the characters in <strong>Brideshead
      Revisited</strong> and <strong>The Good Soldier</strong>
      odiously self-absorbed and uninteresting?
    </p>
    <p>
      Disagree with me? Fine, let's argue, but please don't bother
      to tell me that some work is worthwhile because famous
      critics have anointed it. Am I going to write a better novel?
      No, but my <a href="/physpapers.html">technical
      papers</a> are pretty readable.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Middlemarch</strong> by George Eliot
    </p>
    <p>The only reason to read the remarkably long-winded and scantily
    plotted <strong>Middlemarch</strong> is an interest in the history
    of the development of the English novel.  I have no such interest.
    English majors should stop foisting boring tales of country life
    and protracted marriage negotiations on us general readers.  Those
    who want a vivid and stirring account of 19th century life in
    Britain have a number of more appealing options than Eliot,
    notably her genuinely entertaining contemporaries Charles Dickens
    and Robert Louis Stevenson.

      <strong>Brown: the Last Discovery of America</strong> by
      Richard Rodriguez
    </p>
    <p>
      The photo of Rodriguez on the front cover is a warning:
      <strong>Brown</strong> is not a collection of essays on U.S.
      race relations or even a meditation about American culture so
      much as it is a self-absorbed examination of the author's own
      history. The prose is by turns obtuse and incoherent. Here's
      a sample paragraph:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>
      We cannot. We must be mistaken to live. We do notice,
      however, how oddly we are constructed, how oddly we are
      evolved. Hands. Lips. Birth canals. As are our implements.
      Things we pick up and put down. Gloves. Forceps. The way we
      must hold the guitar constructs the guitar. It stands to
      reason. We have only two hands. The guitar constructs music.
      Music constructs silence. (An Icelandic composer interviewed
      on the radio said silence constructs music.) Silence
      constructs hope or fear. Of ghosts or angels. Cubism is not
      for angels. For angels, as for Virginia Woolf, motive alone
      is manifest.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Rodriguez' preoccupation with unfashionable authors like
      Edith Wharton and D.H. Lawrence is dull, while his conflation
      of Richard Nixon and Benjamin Franklin is just plain wrong.
      Meanwhile we are treated to anecdotes about the migration of
      whales, the glamor of Peter O'Toole, the death from cancer of
      a woman named Lynn, and the significance of foghorns. So
      rambling and disconnected is <strong>Brown</strong> that I'm
      surprised that it doesn't come to us from a vanity press.
    </p>

      <strong>John Dollar</strong> by Marianne Wiggins
    </p>
    <p>
      I read this book in about 1990, but I distinctly remember my
      reaction on reaching the end: I walked out to the dumpster
      and tossed it in. Usually I give books away after I finish
      them, but I really didn't want to subject any of my friends
      to <strong>John Dollar.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly this novel is riveting, but I found the shock to be
      gratuitous. What is point of the children smearing on their
      flesh turds that are digested remnants of their parents? I
      got the impression from the mixed cast that the story was
      supposed to be some kind of parable about colonialism, but
      who cares?
    </p>

      <strong>Gut Symmetries</strong> by Jeannette Winterson
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeannette Winterson sure can write. <strong>Gut
      Symmetries</strong> , like <strong>John Dollar</strong>, has
      a lot of lyrical charm in its first chapters. Then once
      again, the reader is subjected to disgusting scenes where one
      major character eats parts of another, who is still alive.
      Obviously cannibalism is the last taboo and daring young
      authors have resorted to its use in order to attract the
      attention of bored readers. Too bad for them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also read Winterson's <strong>Sexing the Cherry</strong>
      and found it dreary and a bit dull. Obviously Winterson has a
      great novel in her, and I hope she writes it soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The God of Small Things</strong> by Arundhati Roy
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn't. Just couldn't.<br />
      Just couldn't stand the way this smarmysmarty book was
      written. Dee-dum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arundhati Roy certainly has a unique and recognizable style,
      and it's a very annoying one. The writing in <strong>The God
      of Small Things</strong> is tugging constantly at your
      sleeve, screaming, "Pay attention to me!" I give her credit
      for an artful depiction of how small children talk and think,
      but I can't bear to read another word of her prose. I've lost
      interest in what happens to Velutha and in how Sophie Mol
      died, despite the foreboding and foreshadowing that have been
      spread on with a trowel. For a good Subcontinental novel,
      read Rohinton Mistry's <strong>A Fine Balance</strong>
      instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Pay it Forward</strong> by Catherine Ryan Hyde
    </p>
    <p>
      The well-known premise of this novel sustains your interest
      as you struggle through pages of painfully clumsy writing.
      While the book is nominally about the "pay it forward" scheme
      for saving the world invented by a boy named Trevor, most of
      the verbiage focuses on the more conventional romance between
      Trevor's mother and his high school teacher. It doesn't help
      matters that this romance strains credulity as much as the
      success of the "pay it forward" scheme. In the second half
      the plot is completely predictable as the author labors
      towards the almost-happy ending. <strong>Pay it
      Forward</strong> is for feel-good fans only, which is too bad
      since the book's concept deserves a better novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Angle of Repose</strong> by Wallace Stegner.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the characterization of artist and mother Susan was
      vivid, that of husband and mining engineer Oliver is a bit
      sketchy. Presumably this asymmetry was intentional because
      the book was purported to be based on Susan's writings, but
      nonetheless I felt it hurt the book, if only because I found
      Susan to be so whiny and unsympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      My main problem is with the ending. The incident that the
      whole book leads up to is glossed over and described in only
      a few pages! I'm speaking of course about the drowning of
      Susan and Oliver's daughter and their subsequent temporary
      breakup. Why no description of the years of their separation;
      did Susan write no letters then? What of her communication
      with her childhood friend; did they cease correspondence? I
      really was motivated to slog through the long descriptions of
      Susan's despair in various mining towns by the anticipation
      of reading about Susan and Oliver's eventual reconciliation
      and about the wisdom and maturity of her later years. Then
      the books effectively ends at the time of their breakup,
      leaving these questions unanswered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both <strong>Angle of Repose</strong> and <strong>The
      Spectator Bird</strong> left me pretty cold. I'm adding
      Stegner to the list of much-praised contemporary authors
      (Joyce Carol Oates, Nadine Gordimer, etc.) that don't appeal
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Confederacy of Dunces</strong> by John Kennedy Toole
    </p>
    <p>
      This literary equivalent to watching the Three Stooges is the
      most overrated book of recent times. Evidently some readers
      are cracked up by the pratfalls of stupid and delusional
      people, but I'm just not one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</strong> by Rebecca West
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed out loud several times while reading <strong>Black
      Lamb and Grey Falcon</strong> and I neither chuckled nor
      smiled during the entirety of <strong>Confederacy of
      Dunces</strong>. In parts this book, a travelogue, is very
      funny. The bad news is that the humor, while refreshingly
      nasty, is also disturbingly condescending. German tourists
      are ridiculed. The Austrian Empire is found to be pitifully
      bourgeois. Croats and Serbs who live in rural areas are
      called "peasants," which I suspect to be anachronism even for
      1941. (Or was the connotation different in England pre-war?)
      Repeated exclamations are made that there is an intellectual
      life in Croatia! as if anyone less snobbish than West might
      doubt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Sotweed Factor</strong> by John Barth
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the same problem with this book as with
      <strong>Confederacy of Dunces</strong>: I found the main
      character to be so unsympathetic and annoying as to have
      difficulty sustaining interest in the narrative. Interspersed
      with the tale of the twitly "Poet Laureate of Maryland" are
      purported excerpts from the journals of Captain John Smith,
      he of Pocahontas fame. The John Smith sections are
      hilariously irreverent, and they would be well worth reading
      if they were collected alone. Alas, I gave up on this book
      about 1/3 of the way through, although that was at a
      respectable 200 pages or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The White Hotel</strong> by D.M. Thomas
    </p>
    <p>
      This novel contains elements of magical realism and is about
      weird sex and the Holocaust, making it sort of the
      <strong>Lincoln's Doctor's Dog</strong> of our time. While
      the book is well-written, the first hundred pages or so reads
      like a not particularly imaginative <strong>Penthouse
      Letter</strong>. The portrait of Sigmund Freud and early 20th
      century Vienna is interesting but it makes up only a small
      part. The overall impression I get is that Thomas is capable
      of writing worthwhile fiction, but that this book was aimed
      straight at the bestseller list.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Wanderlust: A History of Walking</strong> by Rebecca
      Solnit
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't read this book; pick up Bruce Chatwin's wonderful
      <strong>Anatomy of Restlessness</strong> or <strong>The
      Songlines</strong> instead. Solnit has little to say that
      Chatwin didn't say earlier and better. To the extent that her
      book is original, it's about Rousseau and feminism,
      Wordsworth and leftist politics, not nomadic lifestyles or
      walking. Where Chatwin's style is soaring and poetic,
      Solnit's is mannered and cramped. <strong>Wanderlust</strong>
      is a big-time bore.
