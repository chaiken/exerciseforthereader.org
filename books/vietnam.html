          <strong><a name="lie" id="lie">A Bright Shining Lie</a>:
          John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam</strong> by Neil
          Sheehan.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>A Bright Shining Lie</b> won several prizes and
          deserved them. It's both a biography of an exceptionally
          devoted soldier and a history of the failure of the war.
          I learned a lot by reading it; for example, I didn't know
          that the Viet Cong had tanks. I didn't know that "Viet
          Cong" was a term made up by the American military. I
          didn't know that Daniel Ellsberg was a Marine who had
          once supported the war effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to describe only the factual content of this book is
          to underrate it. Vann was a personal friend of Sheehan's,
          and the book is emotionally charged. In writing this
          work, Sheehan found out some shocking aspects of Vann's
          life that he didn't expect. The 800+ pages go by a lot
          faster than you would think.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all the hand-wringing about military incompetence in
          Vietnam that one read in the '70's from armchair
          generals, it's easy to forget how many brilliant,
          dedicated people died there. This book is a useful
          corrective in that regard. One could easily argue that
          the military today is still crippled by having lost the
          best of its people in Southeast Asia.

          <strong>The Long Gray Line</strong> by Rick Atkinson.
        </p>
        <p>
          Atkinson's book is a nonfiction account of the lives and
          deaths of the West Point class of 1966. Like Sheehan's book,
          Atkinson's is very sad but well worth reading
          nonetheless. Atkinson convincingly argues that since the
          class of '66 had more casualties in Southeast Asia than any
          other, its story is really the story of the war.  While
          there is a certain amount of discussion of the '66's as a
          group, what really brings the book to life are the stories
          of individual soldiers, some of whom were military successes
          and some of whom were washouts. One of the class went on to
          spearhead the effort to build the Vietnam Veterans Memorial,
          another died in the DMZ in Korea and others died on the
          ground in Vietnam. The subject matter of <strong>The Long
          Gray Line</strong> belies the title in that it reminds us
          that soldiers had different motives in going into the Army:
          personal ambition, patriotism, family
          tradition. Unfortunately the class of '66 had little luck in
          achieving its aspirations.

          <strong>Fire in the Lake</strong> by Frances FitzGerald
        </p>
        <p>
          This book deserves special mention since its focus is not
          on the Americans in Vietnam, but squarely on the
          Vietnamese themselves. The entire history of the country
          is summarized up through the French occupation and
          withdrawal. More importantly, the culture of Vietnam is
          described, with its important Confucian, Buddhist and
          agrarian traditions. FitzGerald describes the failure of
          the war effort as the inevitable result of the complete
          inability of the Americans to understand the Vietnamese
          people. In fact, she makes the case that not much of an
          attempt was even made. It's significant that this book is
          the only famous treatise on the War (as far as I know)
          which is primarily about Vietnamese in Vietnam, not about
          Americans.
        </p>
        <p>
          FitzGerald's work portrays Ho Chi Minh as a genius of
          grass roots political organization, something like the
          Ralph Reed of his time (!). The Americans made a
          conceptual mistake in believing the war to have only two
          sides, and they never understood that the South
          Vietnamese Army wouldn't fight because the soldiers felt
          they had no personal stake in the war. The analysis is
          quite interesting although sometimes a bit too detailed
          for my taste. The description of the Buddhist religious
          figures and their political campaigns was particularly
          enlightening. <strong>Fire in the Lake</strong> won the
          Pulitzer and the National Book Award.

          <strong>About Face</strong> by <a href=
          "http://www.hackworth.com/">Colonel David H.
          Hackworth</a> (US Army, ret.) and Julie H. Sherman
        </p>
        <p>
          Hackworth's remarkable memoir describes his service
          during the Vietnam and Korean Wars and the peacetime
          in-between. It helps answer the "what went wrong?"
          question from the American perspective. Hackworth argues
          convincingly that the roots of Vietnam-era problems go
          far earlier, to the post-WWII era when the Army was
          down-sizing. During that time the Army instituted a
          "zero-defect" policy and began its emphasis on
          scholar-soldiers with advanced degrees. Many "warriors"
          with Hackworth's working-class background were mustered
          out, and less-than-honest performance evaluations and
          rampant "grade inflation" in battle assessments began to
          be the norm. Hackworth clearly feels that once officers
          learned to lie, the inflated "body counts" and ridiculous
          propaganda of the Vietnam War were almost inevitable.
          Hackworth's anecdotes about "ticket punching" among
          careerists in the Army are disquieting, although his
          description of the "M-1 pencil" (a writing utensil that
          could be used to punch a bullseye in a target) is
          amusing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hackworth has credibility in his criticisms of the Army
          if only because he is the US's most decorated living
          soldier. He has seen combat from the inside, and in
          <strong>About Face</strong>, he tells us all about it. I
          admire this book both for its constructiveness (Hackworth
          makes specific and thoughtful recommendations for reform)
          and its you-are-there intensity. Some of Hackworth's
          amazing tales of battlefield heroism have a tall-tale
          quality, but the vivid details and the overall feeling of
          sadness make me believe them. <strong>About Face</strong>
          took me six enjoyable weeks to read since its
          blow-by-blow battle descriptions cannot be skimmed. To
          his credit, Hackworth's accounts of the "forgotten war"
          in Korea are every bit as gripping as his descriptions of
          those of the Vietnam War. He makes it clear that military
          planning had already gone far wrong in the '50s.

          <strong>Dispatches</strong> by Michael Herr
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a grunts-eye view of the war told by a correspondent
          who was on the ground in Khe Sanh and Hue.  Herr's concerns
          are not political or military but primarily personal, since
          he spends most of the time describing what the experience of
          Vietnam was like for individual Marines. It's refreshing to
          hear the stories by people who were actually in the thick of
          the fighting after reading so much analysis. Herr's
          anecdotes about life among war correspondents in Saigon
          provides welcome comical relief. At a mere 260 pages, this
          book is a lot more portable than most of the others.

          <strong>The March of Folly: from Troy to Vietnam</strong>
          by Barbara Tuchman
        </p>
        <p>
          Tuchman's history of government incompetence through the
          ages compares the US's entrance into the Vietnam War to
          the other really big historical boners. Tuchman defines
          folly as a calculated act undertaken with sufficient
          foreknowledge that its irrationality should have been
          readily apparent. Therefore, a really impressive blunder
          requires a Cassandra to warn about it in advance. Tuchman
          establishes in the case of Vietnam that plenty of wise
          old Asia hands warned that following in the footsteps of
          the humiliated French was not too bright. Time of course
          proved them right. Tuchman's analysis of the beginning of
          the American revolution in another section is also well
          worth reading.

          <strong>Going after Cacciato</strong> by Tim O'Brien
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't actually dislike this novel, but I didn't find
          it very satisfying either. It deals with the War only
          very tangentially. Perhaps if I'd picked it up without
          any expectations I wouldn't have been disappointed.

          <strong>Delta Force</strong> by Col. Charlie Beckwith
        </p>
        <p>
          Beckwith's book is sincere and funny and strong on
          mission planning and military politics. If you want to
          know what combat is like or why we lost the Vietnam War,
          look elsewhere.

          <strong>On Strategy: A critical analysis of the Vietnam
          War</strong> by <a
          href="http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/conversations/Summers/">Col.
          Harry G. Summers, Jr.</a> [be sure to follow this link]
        </p>
        <p>
          A "critical analysis" of the War by an Army War College
          faculty member sounds like a complete snooze, but
          <strong>On Strategy</strong> is a remarkably plainspoken
          and direct account that isn't afraid to point fingers and
          name names. As the title suggests, the author believes
          that the primary cause of the military catastrophe was
          the lack of a coherent political strategy. Summers
          identifies Johnson's decision not to seek a declaration
          of war as the great initial mistake; the Gulf of Tonkin
          resolution began the long campaign of government
          deception. The fatal error was to be distracted by the
          militarily less significant Viet Cong rather than stay
          focused on the regular North Vietnamese Army. Summers
          points out that the major battles of the war (Dien Bien
          Phu, 1954; Ia Drang, 1965; Tet, 1968; Eastertide, 1972;
          and the final conquest, 1975) all corresponded to major
          troop incursions from the North. He makes an unfavorable
          comparison with the Korean War, where US forces worked to
          repel the North Koreans and left internal matters to the
          South Koreans. Summers suggests that the US could have
          won had it concentrated all its energies on simply
          blocking southward troop and materiel movements all along
          the DMZ to the Thai border.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>On Strategy</strong> is organized around
          quotations from Carl von Clausewitz' <strong>On
          War</strong> with contrasting excerpts from the Army
          Field Service Manual of 1962. Summers argues that the
          military foolishly believed that it faced unique
          circumstances in Vietnam, while in truth the application
          of classic doctrine from the 19th century would have
          produced better results. Refreshingly <strong>On
          Strategy</strong> praises the leadership of the North
          Vietnam military, who seem to have thought more clearly
          about their goals than the US leadership did. This book
          was recommended by retired Army General Jack Merritt.

          <strong>Fields of Fire</strong> by James H. Webb
        </p>
        <p>
          Like <strong>Dispatches</strong>, this novel is a
          bottoms-up, day-by-day account of the life of Marines
          mired in the muck and almost-tedious danger of daily
          combat in Vietnam. The book has vivid descriptions but
          features too many characters, and the presentation of the
          back stories of each character kills the narrative's
          momentum. The love scenes between the hero Robert Lee
          Hodges Jr. and his Japanese girlfriend are somewhat
          painful to read. The author takes quite a few jabs at the
          incompetent if not malicious military brass and the
          hypocritical draft-dodgers back in North America. While
          the story is quite affecting in parts, <strong>Fields of
          Fire</strong> is something of a weak novel.

          <strong>A Rumor of War</strong> by Philip Caputo
        </p>
        <p>
          Caputo's non-fiction account covers the same ground as
          Webb's novel: the day-by-day, trudge-by-trudge life of a
          Marine in Vietnam. Caputo's tour occurred in the first year
          of the war, and his account of the troops' optimism and
          naivete during the early days is affecting. It's depressing
          to read how futile the US's military actions were from the
          very first boots-on-the-ground. In the early parts of the
          book Caputo is a sympathetic narrator but the tone
          dramatically and peculiarly shifts at the point where he
          recounts his trial for war crimes. My only other complaint
          is with the pretentious snippets of classic poetry at
          chapter heads, which are out of place in a book about
          trenchfoot and artillery. <strong>Fields of Fire</strong>
          and <strong>A Rumor of War</strong> read together are more
          interesting than they would be separately.  Thanks to Lynn
          Kozma for the recommendation.

          <strong>Highest Traditions</strong> by <a href=
          "http://home.earthlink.net/~tlazzarini/id1.html">Tony
          Lazzarini</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Lazzarini was a helicopter door gunner in Vietnam during
          1965-1967 and <strong>Highest Traditions</strong> is a very
          personal memoir of his two tours of duty. The book includes
          some striking firsthand accounts of missions to apply Agent
          Orange and to covertly infiltrate Cambodia.  Lazzarini's
          writing is informal and conversational, as if you were
          having a beer with an acquaintance and casually inquired
          about his war service. Since <strong>Highest
          Traditions</strong> has such a tight focus, it wouldn't be a
          good choice for a first book about Vietnam, but its frank
          reporting is has more impact on the reader than many books
          by professional journalists. When describing the death of
          friends or the horrifying emotional impact of the war on
          GI's, Lazzarini's writing will put a lump in almost every
          throat. Nonetheless there are several passages that are very
          funny.  Thanks to Mr. Lazzarini for sending me a copy of his
          book.

      <p><strong>A Short Rhetoric for Leaving the Family</strong> by
      Peter Dimock
      </p>
      <p>Dimock's novel takes the form of a letter from the troubled
      narrator Jarlath Lanham to his nephews Des and General.  The
      title refers to the narrator's formal but rather tortured
      attempt to use the devices of classical rhetoric to convey the
      horror of the Lanham family history to the boys.  The novel is
      particularly clever in the way that it juxtaposes Jarlath's
      strangely mannered rantings with chilling excerpts from the
      Pentagon Papers.  Dimock has done an excellent job of creating a
      disturbed character whose arguments are often sympathetic,
      reminiscent of <strong>The Unabomber Manifesto</strong>.  The
      novel subtly raises the question, just who is crazy here anyway?
      <strong>A Short Rhetoric</strong> is a brief book that makes a
      lasting impression.  Thanks to Gene Heller for the recommendation.

      <p>Stewart O'Nan is a master of high-brow horror and

      strong but distant father figure and an evil double whose
      actions mirror but distort those of the sympathetic narrator.
      While <strong>A Short Rhetoric</strong> is an epistolary novel
      written by the unstable character, <strong>Names of the
      Dead</strong> is a plainly told story grounded in the details of
      everyday life and narrated by the more lucid character.  O'Nan
      is a skillful writer who develops considerable suspense in
      telling the story of Larry Markham, a somewhat damaged veteran
      who's just trying to get by in both family life and the world of
      work.  Thanks to Diane Heckman for the recommendation.

      <p><strong>A Viet Cong Memoir</strong> by Truong Nhu Tang</p>
      <p>Tang's book differs from previous memoirs I've read not only
      because the author writes from a Vietnamese perspective but
      because he tells the story from a political point of view, not a
      military one.  While the War was certainly a traumatic event in
      the United States, reading Tang's memoir brings home how
      nightmarish the time period was for the Vietnamese.  </p>
      <p>Tang was born to a privileged family and was educated in
      France, where he met <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a>
      and was converted to the radical cause.  Upon returning to
      Vietnam he was for many years a secret supporter of the
      resistance until his ultimate arrest and torture.  After Tang
      was released in a prisoner exchange, he headed out to the "Iron
      Triangle" jungle region where he became a minister in the <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Revolutionary_Government_of_the_Republic_of_South_Vietnam">Provisional
      Revolutionary Government</a>.  The memoir features vivid
      descriptions about being on the receiving end of B-52 attacks,
      which eventually caused the PRG to flee to Cambodia.  There the
      PRG was subject to the notorious "secret Christmas bombing."
      </p>
      <p>Tang discusses in vivid detail how the many American missteps
      played into the propaganda plans of the revolutionaries.  The
      most fascinating section describes Tang's creeping realization
      that the North Vietnamese had no intention of allowing a
      democratic, independent South Vietnam.  The tale of how the
      northerners subverted the PRG and took power after the "Great
      Spring Victory" is chilling.  Despite the fact that Tang was
      nominally Minister of Justice, several of his brothers were
      forced into re-education camps and one never returned.  The last
      chapter describes Tang's escape as a <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat_people">"boat
      person."</a>
      </p>
      <p>A political memoir of the war may sound like a deadly
      prospect, but <strong>A Viet Cong Memoir</strong> is required
      reading for anyone who cares about the history of the conflict.
      While much of the book lacks the you-are-there immediacy of a
      great memoir, the behind-the-scenes of analysis of events like
      the Paris Peace Talks will greatly interest anyone who remembers
      the early 1970's.

          Discussed <a href="fict.html#dog">on a different

          only incidentally about the war but well worth
          reading.
