      Results and Discussion
    </h1>
    <p>
      <a href="fig2.html">Figure 2a</a> shows NiFe surface steps
      revealed in reflected light on the NiO/NiFe bilayer
      epitaxially deposited onto MgO (001). They are created by the
      intersection of screw dislocation slip planes with the top
      NiFe surface. <a href="fig2.html">Figure 2b</a> shows a
      birefringence picture of the same area due to effective
      internal microstresses caused by edge dislocations aligned
      along (110) and (110) slip planes. Both screw and edge
      dislocations were introduced into the MgO substrate while
      cleaving the substrate prior to the bilayer deposition. The
      steps on the top NiFe surface indicate that these MgO
      dislocations propagated during the deposition through the NiO
      and NiFe layers and, hence, these screw dislocations also
      introduced steps into the interface of the bilayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MOIF images shown in <a href="fig3.html">Fig. 3</a>
      illustrate the behavior of the domain structure in the biased
      MgO(001)/NiO/NiFe sample during reversal of its magnetization
      along the [110] unidirectional axis. The sample was first
      magnetized to saturation with the field &micro;H = -30 mT
      aligned opposite the direction of the unidirectional
      anisotropy. The MOIF image of the saturated sample (not
      shown) was homogeneous and only stray magnetic fields at the
      sample edge were revealed (as a black band). As the applied
      field was decreased, incoherent rotation of the magnetization
      occurs (<a href="fig3.html">Fig. 3a</a>), resulting in an
      inhomogeneous distribution of spins which is entirely
      associated with the dislocation structure of the sample
      (compare with <a href="fig2.html">Fig. 2</a>). Upon
      increasing the applied field in the reverse sense, a large
      amount of domain nucleation occurs at the dislocation slip
      planes and at their intersections (<a href="fig3.html">Fig.
      3b</a>). These new domains grow slightly until domain wall
      annihilation occurs. At this point, the domains disappear,
      and an inhomogeneous distribution of magnetization similar to
      that shown in <a href="fig3.html">Fig. 3a</a> appears.
    </p>
    <p>
      For magnetization reversal in the opposite direction, the
      domain structure changes in a similar fashion to the above
      picture. However, nucleation of reversed-phase domains occurs
      at defferent local centers (<a href="fig3.html">Fig. 3c,
      d</a>). In addition, nucleation starts at a larger absolute
      value of the reversed applied field because the applied field
      in this direction must overcome the unidirectional
      anisotropy. Consistent with this behavior, an asymmetric
      hysteresis loop is observed (Fig. 1a). This loop exhibits an
      exchange shift &micro;H<sub>E</sub> = 3.5 mT and coercive
      field &micro;H<sub>C</sub> = 4 mT.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the NiO/NiFe bilayer having a [110] unidirectional
      anisotropy axis the most significant feature of the
      remagnetization process is the complicated domain structure
      resulting from the strong influence of edge and screw
      dislocations on both spin rotation and domain nucleation and
      growth. In fact, it is observed that the dislocations pin
      these domain walls so effectively that the domain sizes do
      not exceed the spacing between neighboring dislocation slip
      planes. It should be emphasized that while the screw
      dislocations introduce inhomogeneous internal stresses and
      additionally create steps at the NiO/NiFe interface (which
      can frustrate the interface NiO/NiFe magnetization vectors),
      the edge dislocations introduce only inhomogeneous internal
      stresses. This difference suggests that the induced
      inhomogeneous magnetic anisotropy due to magnetoelastic
      interactions plays an important role in the remagnetization
      of the bilayer. For the NiO/NiFe bilayer biased along the
      [110] direction, the edge dislocations also make complete
      saturation of the magnetization along the bias axis very
      difficult. <a href="fig4.html">Figure 4</a> shows for this
      case, that non-uniform magnetization always exists along the
      [110] slip planes. Remagnetization along the [110] axis is
      accompanied by the vertical motion of a vortex wall along the
      slip plane, resulting in a change in contrast on the slip
      plane, but still leaving behind light/dark contrast bands
      indicating changes in magnetization direction. This contrast
      banding remains up to higher fields. For remagnetization
      along a hard-axis no shift in the hysteresis loop was
      observed, and the coercivity was very small.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an unidirectional anisotropy was induced along the [100]
      direction in the NiO/NiFe bilayer, the dislocations also
      stimulate domain nucleation and impede domain wall motion.
      However, in this case the domain walls can more easily
      overcome the dislocations barriers, and therefore, the domain
      sizes are larger (<a href="fig5.html">Fig. 5</a>). Compare,
      for example, Fig. <a href="fig2.html">2</a> and <a href=
      "fig5.html">5</a>. It is obvious from <a href=
      "fig5.html">Fig. 5</a> that the domains in the [100] biased
      bilayer can grow to sizes much larger than the dislocation
      slip planes spacing. The measured unidirectional exchange
      field (&micro;H<sub>E</sub> = 2 mT) and coercivity
      (&micro;H<sub>C</sub> = 2.6 mT) of this bilayer are smaller
      than that in the NiO/NiFe bilayer with a [110] unidirectional
      biased axis. This means that the reversal process depends on
      the relationship between the unidirectional and an induced
      anisotropies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MOIF images of the domain structure taken during the
      [110] easy-axis magnetization reversal of a free NiFe layer
      (grown on MgO (001) without a NiO buffer) in two opposite
      directions are shown in <a href="fig6.html">Fig. 6</a>. The
      dislocation structure of this sample is also similar to the
      one shown in <a href="fig2.html">Fig. 2</a>. As is obvious,
      there is no strong dislocation influence on the domain
      structure of the free NiFe layer. This is due to an almost
      zero magnetostriction in the NiFe. Domains nucleate and
      disappear, as a rule, at film edges for both field directions
      due to a minimization of stray fields at edges.
      Remagnetization proceeds by the growth of domains over the
      whole sample. Though these particular patterns were obtained
      for the 50 nm thickness NiFe, such a behavior is typical for
      free ferromagnetic films with different thicknesses.[10]
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparison of the domain structure behavior in the free
      ferromagnetic film (<a href="fig6.html">Fig. 6</a>) with that
      in the exchange-biased film (Fig. 3) led us to propose that
      dislocations in the NiO/NiFe bilayer influence primarily the
      spin configurations in the antiferromagnetic layer. This
      antiferromagnetic layer, however, affects the behavior of
      spins in the ferromagnetic layer. To confirm this
      proposition, we show in <a href="fig7.html">Fig. 7</a> the
      domain patterns taken during remagnetization of a
      polycrystalline NiO/NiFe bilayer (<a href="fig7.html">Fig.
      7a</a>) and a free NiFe layer (<a href="fig7.html">Fig.
      7b</a>) deposited on Si substrates. It is obvious that the
      domain structure in the polycrystalline NiO/NiFe bilayer is
      complicated and fine-scaled. On the contrary, in the
      polycrystalline NiFe layer, the remagnetization proceeds by
      the motion of almost rectilinear domain walls with cross ties
      over large distances. It does indicate that the
      polycrystalline structure in the NiO affects the
      magnetization reversal process in the bilayer.<br />
