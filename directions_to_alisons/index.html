    How to get to Alison's Apartment in Mountain View
    </h1>
    <hr />

<p>
<h3>Apt. 41, 1555 W. Middlefield Rd. 94043<br/>650-279-5600<br/>37.407682 N, 122.082916 W</h3>
</p>

<p><img src="gmapMV.png"><br/>The green arrow indicates 1555
W. Middlefield while the actual apartment location is a
blue + sign.</p>

<p>Navigate to 1555 W. Middlefield Rd., turn southwest on San Pierre
and then hang a right on San Ramon.    Pass the first parking lot on
your right and then park near the second parking lot on your right.
You will see the red fence across the street from the parking lot.

at your back.</p>

lot, with trashcans and dumpsters on right.</p>

<p>The red fence is directly across the street from the apartment,
which is right above the dumpsters and trashcans.  Enter the second
parking light and take the path that comes out in the far right
corner.  Do not go through the gate to the pool, but turn right.</p>

<p>Go up the first stairs on your right and knock on the door of
number 41.</p>

<p>From the north/west direction on San Ramon to when you're facing
the apartment door, you have turned 360&#176; by making four right
turns.  The red fence is visible from the stairway outside the door.
