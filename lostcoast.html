    <h2>
      Part I, Summer of '94 trip:
    </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.wsrcc.com/wolfgang/">Wolfgang</a> and I went
      for a 10-day long trip up along the north coast, staying in the
      following places:
    </p>
    <p>
      1) <a href=
      "http://cal-parks.ca.gov/DISTRICTS/russian/spsp248.htm">Salt
      Point State Park</a>, north of Jenner. Best tidepools that I
      know of anywhere. Good seal-watching. This park recently
      suffered a severe fire, though, and isn't what it used to be.
      The walk-in campsites are closed. No groceries near this
      park, so take plenty of rations along. Kites and great blue
      herons; a dozen woodpeckers on the dead trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) <a href=
      "http://www.mcn.org/1/mendoparks/manchst.htm">Manchester
      State Beach</a>, in Manchester. Very nice, private walk-in
      campsites in the dunes. Quiet. Not much to do though, if
      you're not a beach person. The shore is sandy, not rocky, but
      the water is still cold. This is where the San Andreas goes
      out to sea, as is apparent by looking at the topography.
    </p>
    <p>
      3) <a href=
      "http://www.mcn.org/1/mendoparks/macker.htm">Mackerricher
      State Beach</a> north of Mendocino. Nice enough, but not
      worth the extra drive north from Salt Point. More seals and
      tidepools. Lots of kites (the avian kind). Walk-in campsites
      here were closed for no apparent reason. On the way to
      Mackerricher, we had considered staying at Jackson State
      Forest. As we drove down the road to the campsite marked on
      our map, we saw a sign saying that it was under supervision
      of the CA Dept of Corrections, and that only authorized
      personnel should enter. This discouraged us.
    </p>
    <p>
      4) <a href=
      "http://cal-parks.ca.gov/DISTRICTS/ncrd/swsp.html">Sinkyone
      Wilderness State Park</a> on the Lost Coast. A beautiful
      isolated place. The road there from the south, Usal Road, is
      really treacherous; allow 35 minutes for the 6-mile drive. We
      didn't drive all the way down the access road from the north
      (Chemise Mountain Road), but it seemed better. The campsites
      themselves were unattractive, but the setting is spectacular:
      steep hills on 3 sides and the ocean on the other. We planned
      to go hiking on the Lost Coast trail, but the area was
      totally socked in by fog. More seals, kites and herons. (The
      north coast is tedious that way ;-)) No drinking water here,
      and nothing even to filter; you must bring it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      5) Kings Range Conservation Area, north of Shelter Cove. We
      made our own campsite on top of the ridge just north of
      Shelter Cove. The view was panoramic; we could see nearly 180
      degrees worth of breaking surf, and only wooded hills in the
      other direction. We shot at cans with a pistol and no one
      complained. Unfortunately it was so windy at night that we
      couldn't sleep, but I'm glad we went anyway. Note: at first
      we went to have a look at the Tolkan and Horse Mountain
      campsites, but a large group of men wearing matching blue
      uniforms was refurbishing them under the direction of a man
      with a gun! No drinking water here, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      6) <a href=
      "http://www.northcoast.com/~hrsp/Welcome.html">Humboldt
      Redwoods State Park</a>, near Scotia. After our wilderness
      experience on the BLM land, we retreated to the prepackaged
      safety of a kitschy state park. The redwoods are spectacular,
      but yecch, go see them elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      7) <a href=
      "http://www.fs.fed.us/img/xrec_ca_nv_north.conf?104,108">Six
      Rivers National Forest</a>, Ruth Reservoir campground. We got
      there mid Friday afternoon and had a great time swimming in
      the water, which was clean and a pleasant temperature. The
      setting of the lake among the peaceful green hillsides was
      idyllic until the jet skiers arrived late that evening. The
      next day we tried to go hiking up to Mad River Rock, but
      couldn't find the dirt road turnoff to the trailhead.
      (Clearly marked on the map, it was one of a dozen unlabelled
      dirt roads in real life.) Unfazed, we drove to Forest Glen in
      <a href=
      "http://www.r5.fs.fed.us/shastatrinity/">Shasta-Trinity
      National Forest</a> and attempted to hike up to the "Marble
      Caves" on Copper Mountain. This time we found the trailhead
      with some effort, but discovered the trail to be a jeep track
      littered with blowdowns. We only got up a mile or so before
      we decided to cut our losses. We plinked at some more cans,
      ate lunch, and started home.
    </p>
    <p>
      8) <a href=
      "http://cal-parks.ca.gov/DISTRICTS/nobuttes/wbsra129.htm">Woodson
      Bridge State Recreation Area</a>. We stayed here on the way
      back to the Bay Area. This is a Sacramento River
      fishing/boating area. There are even boat-in campsites.
      Lacking a boat, we stayed in one of the pedestrian campsites.
      There is swimming in the river nearby at Tehama County Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      All in all it was a great trip. We definitely plan to return
      to Mendocino, Six Rivers, and Shasta-Trinity National Forests
      and would like to have a go at the Trinity Alps and Lassen.
      But first I have to save some more vacation!
    </p>
    <h2>
      Part II, Summer of '95 trip:
    </h2>
    <p>
      1)-2) Kings Range Conservation Area: Stayed close by where we
      stayed in '95, but this time in a spot sheltered from the
      wind. We hiked along the ridgetop to the peak of Saddle
      Mountain the second day. Views were good although not better
      than Horse Mountain. Noted with alarm that the ocean below
      was fogged in (ominous foreshadowing here!).
    </p>
    <p>
      3) Drove up along the coast through scenery that constantly
      made us want to stop, but we pressed on. We were going to
      drive through Ferndale, but the going was slow enough that we
      decided to save that for the next trip. Went into Eureka
      where we stopped at the <a href=
      "http://realbeer.com/lostcoast/">Lost Coast Brewpub</a>.
      Thanks to <a href="http://www.rahul.net/kpapai/">Ken
      Papai</a> for the recommendation! (You can read Ken's
      <a href="http://www.rahul.net/kpapai/beer/pubrank.nocal.html">
      Northern California Brewpub List</a> for yourself.) Suitably
      refreshed, we headed onwards to <a href=
      "http://cal-parks.ca.gov/DISTRICTS/ncrd/hlsp.html">Humboldt
      Lagoons State Park</a>, which we had one hell of a time
      finding. The signs are really confusing given that there are
      several state parks in the area, and we had a hard time
      raising the park service on the phone in order to get the
      gate combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      3)-4) Stayed two nights at Humboldt Lagoons, which has very
      private campsites close to the beach hidden amidst dense
      foliage and twisted conifers. We watched the surf, collected
      agates and hoped that the fog would clear so that we continue
      along the coast to Oregon, which was the plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      5)-6) This was our 3rd consecutive cloudy day. Being
      Californians now, we became depressed and decided to head
      inland, where we knew it would be sunny. We turned south and
      headed inland (east) along Route 299 along the Trinity River.
      In Willow Creek we headed north on Rte 96 and camped in the
      <a href=
      "http://www.fs.fed.us/img/xrec_ca_nv_north.conf?104,108">Six
      Rivers National Forest</a> at Tish Tang campground on the
      Trinity. The sun was shining bright and I was truly glad to
      see it. Swimming in the warm river water was a delight after
      collecting several days worth of grime. We repeatedly saw
      bald eagles soaring above the river. The second day we drove
      out on bumpy dirt roads past Horse Linto campground (which
      looked kind of desolate) and went plinking out in the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      7)-8) Enough of river camping, it was time to head out to
      Clair Engle (Trinity) Lake in <a href=
      "http://www.r5.fs.fed.us/shastatrinity/">Shasta-Trinity
      National Forest</a>. The drive along the Trinity River to the
      Lake from Willow Creek was very scenic; we got good views of
      the Trinity Alps and saw lots of kayakers and canoeists
      running whitewater. We drove around the lake and looked at
      national forest campsites, which were packed with boating
      enthusiasts since it was a sunny weekend day. Deciding we
      couldn't end the vacation listening to jetskis whine, we
      drove around to a deserted southern arm of the lake, where we
      camped on the mudflat created by the lake's ever-changing
      level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The campsite was a bit strange, at the bottom of a gully and
      the end of a dirt road, but the lake was tranquil and clear.
      For me the highlight of the trip was watching a water snake
      swim around hunting. I was amazed to watch it eat a
      salamander, which it wrestled with before our eyes. And there
      were turtles, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was the end of the trip. Due to weather problems, we
      didn't make it all the way up the coast to Oregon, which was
      the original plan. But there's still 1996!
    </p>
    <h2>
      Part III, Summer of '96 Trip:
    </h2>
    <p>
      This was the first <strong>GPS-enhanced</strong> vacation
      trip. We haven't gotten quite as nerdly as <a href=
      "http://microship.com/">Steve Roberts</a> in our mode of
      traveling, but give us a few years.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start the trip out right, we stopped at <a href=
      "http://www.mendobrew.com/">Mendocino Brewing Company</a> on
      the way up. The draft beer there tasted <strong>much
      better</strong> than it does in bottles. Properly refreshed
      and invigorated, we set out for
    </p>
    <p>
      1)-2) Kings Range Conservation Area again, this time on a
      slightly different part of the Horse Mountain area. The sun
      was out over the ocean this time, making the scene even more
      spectacular than before, but the first night was cold! I was
      having doubts about the wisdom of going camping in NCa the
      third week of September, although we did have benefit of a
      full moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all my anxiety the first night, the weather was plenty
      warm for the rest of the trip. Some cold mice did nest in the
      engine compartment of the car, though. The second morning we
      awoke to the sound of gunfire, although we were relieved to
      see that it was evidently not directed at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      3)-4) These two nights were spent at the Mattole River
      Campground on the northern end of Kings Range. The drive from
      Horse Mountain to Mattole River is a pleasure; both the Kings
      Range peaks and the river valley itself are impressive enough
      that you find yourself constantly wanting to pause and let
      the day pass. There's no doubt we could spend a lot of time
      in this area!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mattole River campground is very civilized, with pit
      toilets and all, and it doesn't have the wild atmosphere of
      Horse Mountain. The beach in this part of the park was pretty
      and we made a pleasant day trip to Ferndale, which is
      unspoiled without being too cute. The drive to Ferndale past
      Cape Mendocino is itself quite memorable although not for the
      faint-hearted. The weather was partly cloudy although overall
      pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      5)-6) After another stop at the Lost Coast Brewery, we headed
      on up once again to Humboldt Lagoons State Park. Once again,
      we faced drizzle! I think there must be fog at these parks
      almost all the time. The campsites can't be beat for quiet
      and vegetation though.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to last out the weather we went and walked around
      the town of Trinidad. We had seafood and more brews at a
      restaurant on a pier overlooking Trinidad's naturally
      enclosed harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      7)-8) We stopped at <a href=
      "http://www.nps.gov/redw/prcreek.htm">Prairie Creek Redwoods
      State Park</a> where there was supposed to be more
      environmental camping. Turned out that these sites were a few
      miles hike from the road towards the ocean. That would be
      fine in good weather, but we had suspicions that these
      campsites were in the undesirable drizzle zone, so we moved
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      We continued on to <a href=
      "http://www.nps.gov/redw/delnort.htm">Del Norte Coast
      Redwoods State Park</a>. It looked pretty buggy and was
      inhabited only by some creepy looking folks, so we decided to
      move on. But here we got the opportunity to take free hot
      showers! Thank you State Parks System.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally we settled in at <a href=
      "http://www.nps.gov/redw/jedsmith.htm">Jedediah Smith
      Redwoods State Park</a> just northeast of Crescent City,
      California's northernmost coastal town. It sounded like Lakes
      Earl and Talawa State Park had nicer campsites than JSRSP,
      but Lakes Park was in the drizzle belt. Our campsite wasn't
      as private as we would like, but it was close to the Smith
      River and among some immense redwoods. Plus the sky was blue
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day we hiked out along the Smith River, California's
      last wild waterway. We were lucky enough to spend a few hours
      watching a kingfisher and some mergansers fish on the river.
      Kingfishers seem to be spiritual kin to hummingbirds, all
      self-important chirping.
    </p>
    <p>
      To round out the trip, we stopped off at Humboldt Brewing
      Company in Arcata. Alas, this isn't much of a place beerwise.
      I'd rank the beer near the Tied House or Seabright, not to be
      compared with the output of stellar institutions like Marin
      Brewing or Pacific Coast or Mendocino Brewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, back to work. Off to Brazil in 2/97.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Part IV, Summer of '97 Trip:
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a different woodsy experience this year, we decided to
      spend most of our vacation in a cabin, the way we often used
      to do in the <a href=
      "http://www.dartmouth.edu/student/doc/">Dartmouth Outing
      Club</a> in those happy days of yore. Accordingly we rented
      <a href=
      "http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/olympic/onfrec/otherrec/cabin.htm#inter">
      Interrorem Cabin</a> in the <a href=
      "http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/olympic/">Olympic National
      Forest</a>. This cabin is located in Washington state on the
      eastern side of the Olympic peninsula near the Hood Canal.
      September is supposed to be a good-weather month in
      Washington, so we had high hopes of spending a lot of time
      <a href=
      "http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/olympic/onfrec/trails/trails.htm">hiking</a>
      the hillsides.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did in fact get in a few memorable hikes. We walked up
      Jupiter Ridge, where we alternately had views of the
      Duckabush and Dosewallips River valleys and saw some varied
      thrushes and a sharp-tailed grouse. It rained the next day so
      we walked down the easy <a href=
      "http://www.olympus.net/onf/onfrec/trails/dayhike.htm">"Ranger
      Hole"</a> Trail from the Cabin to the mighty Duckabush, whose
      water had risen impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      It rained more, so we drove out to the Quinault Rain Forest
      in <a href="http://www.nps.gov/olym/">Olympic National
      Park</a>. (What better to do in a downpour than visit a rain
      forest?) We ate lunch at the historic lodge overlooking Lake
      Quinault and then walked around the multimile nature trail,
      which was truly lined with weird and impressive stuff like
      trees growing out of other trees, trees with unsupported tall
      mangrove-like roots, and ferns growing out of everything that
      had stopped moving even for a moment. As we returned to the
      trailhead near the Lodge, we noticed that the sun had come
      out. It was time to gather by the lakeside, drink beer and
      catch some rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it rained more. What better to do in a downpour than go
      see a waterfall? So we walked out to Murhut Falls, which was
      reasonably impressive and scenic. Also uncrowded on this wet
      mid-September day!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, it rained again. I had read about half of
      <strong>Gravity's Rainbow</strong>, a wonderful but long
      book, and accomplished a similarly impressive beer-drinking
      record. Interrorem Cabin was pleasant, but a wood stove would
      have helped a lot. We had already catalogued the variety of
      slugs around the cabin ("banana," "cigar" and "licorice"
      according to my personal taxonomy). We had examined moss and
      slime from all angles. We had eaten really a lot of oysters
      and clams, which are farmed locally in Hood Canal. There were
      still 4 days of vacation left, and despite the fact that our
      cabin reservation had a full day to run, it was time to move
      on to the land of sunshine hiking.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started driving south, planning to stay near Crater Lake,
      which sounded like an excellent place. The map indicated that
      nearby Diamond Lake in the <a href=
      "http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/umpqua/">Umpqua National Forest</a>
      had campgrounds and access to the <a href=
      "http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/umpqua/rec/hiking/trails/tr3_1456.html">
      Mount Thielsen trailhead</a>. Perfect! But then we heard on
      the radio that it was forecast to snow at 6000 feet and
      above, about the elevation of Diamond Lake. Change of plans!
    </p>
    <p>
      We decided instead to go to <a href=
      "http://www.norcal.parks.state.ca.us/castle.htm">Castle Crags
      State Park</a> near Dunsmuir in the <a href=
      "http://www.shastacascade.org/">Shasta-Trinity region</a>
      that we have visited on all our California vacations. The
      campsites at the park were surrounded by tall trees, sunny
      and private, but the catch proved to be that the noise from
      I-5 was quite noticeable. Since we arrived at about 1 AM on
      the first night , we didn't particularly care, but if we
      would have arrived during the daytime we likely would have
      stayed elsewhere, probably at one of the <a href=
      "http://www.r5.pswfs.gov/shastatrinity/index.htm">Shasta
      National Forest</a> campgrounds or one of the Castle Crags
      environmental campsites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good news was that hiking within the Park was excellent.
      The first day we hiked from the campsite up to the Scenic
      Overlook, where there were picnic tables and views of both
      glaciated Mount Shasta and the remarkable Crags themselves.
      This Overlook made a fine lunch spot. We then proceeded on up
      the Crags trail towards the summit. This was a great hike in
      every way: the trail was smooth and gradual, the air smelled
      of cedar, and the views just kept getting better. The last
      part of the trail is reminiscent of Garden of the Gods in
      Colorado, except the large monoliths around you are granite
      instead of that redstuff. When we got to the summit, thunder
      began to crash around us and we were forced to abort. Still
      this was among the nicest hikes we've done on the West Coast.

      The next day we went off into the National Forest and shot
      things, mostly cans and fruit. Nothing makes a mess like an
      exploding cantaloupe, I must say. (I know you're supposed to
      eat what you kill, but it would have been challenging.) On
      the last day of the trip we hiked up the Dog Trail to the
      Pacific Crest Trail and walked around to see Burstase Falls
      and a last glimpse of the Crags. That's all folks until next
      year, when I'm thinking "High Sierra" or perhaps "Ruby
      Mountains of Nevada" as possible vacation themes.

      If you've ever been on a similar
      drive-around-and-look-for-a-nice-spot camping vacation in the
      Sierra or in the Great Basin, I'd like to <a href=
      "mailto:alison@exerciseforthereader.org">hear from
      you!</a> Ditto if you have a mountain cabin to rent that has
      a woodstove and water but no tv, phone or electricity.
