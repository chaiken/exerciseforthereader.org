    <p>
      The angular and temperature dependence of the upper critical
      field H<sub>c2</sub> of C<sub>4</sub>KHg was previously
      measured by Iye and Tanuma.[<a href=
      "node11.html#iye82">30</a>] The zero-field transition
      temperature of their samples was about 0.8 K. The new study
      reported here has two goals. One goal is to determine if the
      superconducting properties of the gold mixed-phase
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples are similar to those previously
      reported.[<a href="node11.html#iye82">30</a>] The other aim
      is to measure the critical fields of the pink single-phase
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg to see what can be learned about their
      differences with the gold mixed-phase samples.
    </p>
    <p>
      After characterization for staging and phase purity, the
      GIC's were affixed to copper sample holders using Apiezon N
      grease. These sample holders were designed so that the GIC's
      could not move during the H<sub>c2</sub> measurements. The
      sample holders were mounted inside pyrex tubes which were
      then filled with purified helium gas to insure good thermal
      contact with the bath at cryogenic temperatures. After
      mounting, the (00<em>l</em>) x-ray spectrum was taken again
      to insure that no sample deterioration had occurred during
      mounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The superconducting transitions were measured by monitoring
      the ac susceptibility of the sample as the temperature or
      magnetic field was swept. A standard ac inductance bridge[<a
      href="node11.html#abel64">1</a>] with excitation field 0.2 Oe
      at 490 Hz was used to monitor the magnetic susceptibility.
      Temperature readings were obtained from a calibrated
      germanium resistor (Lake Shore GR-200A-100), and from a
      capacitive pressure sensor (MKS Baratron) which monitored the
      <sup>3</sup>He vapor pressure. Given the accuracy with which
      the transition height and dimensions of the intercalated
      specimen are known, it can be stated that the superconducting
      areal fraction of the GIC's used in this experiment was
      typically (80 &plusmn; 20)%. T<sub>c</sub>, the zero-field
      transition temperature, was defined to be the intersection of
      a line drawn tangent to the most linear part of the
      transition with the level upper part of the transition. The
      transition width, <em>delta</em> T<sub>c</sub>, was defined
      as the interval between the 10% and 90% completion
      temperatures of the transition. The dimensionless
      (T<sub>c</sub>-independent) figure of merit used to
      characterize sample quality is <em>delta</em>
      T<sub>c</sub>/T<sub>c</sub>. <em>delta</em> T<sub>c</sub>/
      T<sub>c</sub> ranged from about 0.2 for poorly ordered
      samples to about 10<sup>-2</sup> for well-ordered
      specimens.[<a href="node11.html#chaiken88">10</a>]
      H<sub>c2</sub> was defined as the field where a line drawn
      tangent to the most linear part of the transition intersects
      the level upper portion of the field sweep, the same
      definition as was used in Ref. [<a href=
      "node11.html#iye82">30</a>]. The angle <em>theta</em> that
      was varied in the angular dependence of H<sub>c2</sub>
      measurements was defined the angle between the applied field
      and the graphite c-axis. (Note that this angle is the
      complement of that usually called <em>theta</em> in the
      thin-film superconductivity literature.)
