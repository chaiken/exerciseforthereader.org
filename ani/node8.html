    <p>
      The remaining unsettled issue for C<sub>4</sub>KHg is the
      question of the difference between the pink and gold types of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg. The experimentally verified differences
      between the two types of specimens are summarized in <a href=
      "node12.html">Table II</a>. As mentioned above, extensive
      characterization of the specimens used for the
      low-temperature measurements[<a href=
      "node11.html#chaiken88">10</a>] suggests that the only
      normal-state difference between the gold, low-T<sub>c</sub>
      samples and the pink, T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K samples is that
      the gold specimens contain both the <em>alpha</em> and
      <em>beta</em> phases, while the pink specimens contain only
      the <em>alpha</em> phase. While this finding is of great
      interest, it is far from an explanation of the T<sub>c</sub>
      difference between the pink and gold samples. The suppression
      of the bulk T<sub>c</sub> of a superconductor by the presence
      of a small amount of a second phase is unusual if the second
      phase is not magnetic. Certainly no magnetic ordering is
      anticipated in the <em>beta</em> phase of C<sub>4</sub>KHg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously reported experiments on the hydrogenation[<a href=
      "node11.html#H242">45</a>] and application of pressure[<a
      href="node11.html#delong83">15</a>] to C<sub>4</sub>KHg may
      help to clarify the question of the two types of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg. The hydrogenation experiments[<a href=
      "node11.html#H242">45</a>] showed that a minute amount of
      hydrogen gas can increase the T<sub>c</sub> of the gold
      mixed-phase specimens to 1.5 K, and dramatically narrow the
      superconducting transition.[<a href=
      "node11.html#H242">45</a>] The results of the applied
      pressure experiments were strikingly similar:[<a href=
      "node11.html#delong83">15</a>] a small hydrostatic pressure
      of 0.8 kbar narrows an initially broad superconducting
      transition and increases T<sub>c</sub>. The most obvious
      explanation for the hydrogenation and pressure results would
      seem to be that application of pressure or exposure to
      hydrogen converts the <em>beta</em> phase to <em>alpha</em>
      phase, raising T<sub>c</sub>. However, this hypothesis is
      contradicted by neutron diffraction experiments performed by
      Kim <em>et al.</em> ,[<a href="node11.html#kim84">34</a>]
      which show that the fraction of <em>alpha</em> and
      <em>beta</em> phases in a mixed-phase sample is not changed
      by pressures up to 13.8 kbar.
    </p>
    <p>
      DeLong and Eklund proposed two ideas to explain the
      T<sub>c</sub>(P) data.[<a href="node11.html#delong83">15</a>]
      One proposal is that the pressure induces a disorder-order
      structural transformation which increases T<sub>c</sub> and
      narrows the superconducting transition. A problem with this
      hypothesis has been pointed out by Clarke and Uher,[<a href=
      "node11.html#clarke84">11</a>] who note that the
      reversibility of the pressure-induced transformation at <img
      width="46" height="13" align="bottom" alt="" src=
      "img39.png" /> K is inconsistent with a disorder-order
      transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second proposal of DeLong and Eklund to explain the
      effect of pressure is charge-density wave (CDW)
      suppression.[<a href="node11.html#delong83">15</a>] Rapid
      increases of T<sub>c</sub> with small applied pressures have
      been observed in several of the transition metal
      dichalcogenides (TMDC's).[<a href=
      "node11.html#friend79">23</a>] These increases are widely
      believed to be due to suppression of the CDW that is known
      from other experiments to exist in many of the TMDC's.[<a
      href="node11.html#wilson75">58</a>] Equally suggestive is the
      fact that low-level hydrogenation also rapidly increases
      T<sub>c</sub> in several of the TMDC's that can support a
      CDW.[<a href="node11.html#murphy75">41</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Though none of these similarities between the TMDC's and
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg is direct evidence for the presence of a
      CDW, the possibility of a CDW instability has previously been
      mentioned on the basis of band-structure calculations for
      C<sub>8</sub>K.[<a href="node11.html#inoshita77">28</a>] The
      periodic lattice distortion that is associated with CDW
      formation has never been observed in x-ray[<a href=
      "node11.html#elmakrini80">20</a>] or neutron diffraction[<a
      href="node11.html#kamitakahara84">31</a>] experiments on
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg. This is not proof of the non-existence of a
      CDW, though, since the periodic lattice distortion is usually
      easily observed only in electron diffraction[<a href=
      "node11.html#wilson75">58</a>] or scanning tunnelling
      microscopy experiments.[<a href=
      "node11.html#coleman85">12</a>] In light of the evidence
      which suggests the presence of a CDW in C<sub>4</sub>KHg,
      temperature-dependent microscopy studies of C<sub>4</sub>KHg
      are highly desirable. A search for resistivity and
      susceptibility anomalies associated with CDW formation in
      T<sub>c</sub> = 0.8 K samples would also be of interest.
