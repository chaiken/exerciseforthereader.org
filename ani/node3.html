    <p>
      The C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimens used in these studies were
      synthesized using the two-zone vapor-phase intercalation
      technique pioneered for these materials by El Makrini <em>et
      al.</em> [<a href="node11.html#elmakrini80a">21</a>] The
      starting amalgams ranged in composition from
      K<sub>2</sub>Hg<sub>3</sub> to K<sub>5</sub>Hg<sub>4</sub>.
      No systematic effects were seen as a function of the starting
      alloy composition. The amalgam temperature during
      intercalation was varied between 200&deg;C and 260&deg;C. In
      addition, the graphite temperature was independently varied
      from 0&deg;C to 10&deg;C above the amalgam temperature. The
      intercalation reaction was always allowed to proceed for at
      least two weeks. The intercalation ampoules were withdrawn
      from the furnace after it had cooled nearly to room
      temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timp found that the application of a 10&deg;C temperature
      difference between the graphite and the amalgam during
      intercalation increased disorder and lowered
      T<sub>c</sub>.[<a href="node11.html#N128">53</a>] He reported
      a gold color for low-T<sub>c</sub> disordered specimens and a
      pink color for ordered T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K ones.[<a href=
      "node11.html#N128">53</a>] Timp[<a href=
      "node11.html#N128">53</a>] also reported that a temperature
      difference between the graphite and the amalgam increases the
      amount of the (<em>sqrt</em>3 &times; 2)R(30&deg;, 0&deg;)
      phase as compared with the majority (2 &times; 2)R0&deg;
      phase.[<a href="node11.html#N128">53</a>] The (2 &times;
      2)R0&deg; ordering is associated with a 10.24 &Aring; repeat
      distance and has been called the <em>alpha</em> phase.[<a
      href="node11.html#elmakrini80">20</a>] The (<em>sqrt</em>3
      &times; 2)R(30&deg;, 0&deg;) ordering has been positively
      identified with the repeat distance I<sub>c</sub> = 10.83
      &Aring; by Kamitakahara <em>et al.</em> [<a href=
      "node11.html#kamitakahara84">31</a>] The I<sub>c</sub> =
      10.83 &Aring; phase is called the <em>beta</em> phase.[<a
      href="node11.html#elmakrini80">20</a>] Kim and coworkers[<a
      href="node11.html#kim84">34</a>] report that application of a
      temperature difference during intercalation increases the
      amount of the <em>beta</em> phase, in agreement with the
      finding of Timp.[<a href="node11.html#N128">53</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present study, X-ray and neutron diffraction were used
      to characterize the C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimens for staging
      fidelity and phase purity. The x-ray characterization was
      performed at MIT using Mo K<em>alpha</em> radiation in a
      <em>theta</em>-2<em>theta</em> geometry. Neutron diffraction
      (00<em>l</em>) spectra were taken at the National Institute
      of Science and Technology research reactor using the BT-4
      triple-axis neutron diffractometer with thermal neutrons of
      wavelength 1.528 &Aring;. Neutron diffraction spectra of pink
      (single-phase) and gold (mixed-phase) C<sub>4</sub>KHg
      specimens are shown in Fig. 1. Interestingly, neutron
      diffraction revealed the presence of about 10% <em>beta</em>
      phase in a sample which showed only <em>alpha</em>-phase
      peaks in x-ray diffraction spectra. This inconsistency is
      undoubtedly due to the limited penetration depth of x-rays in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg (about 35 &micro;m). Obviously caution is
      advisable when using x-ray diffraction to interpret the
      results of experiments that measure the bulk properties of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all, over twenty batches of C<sub>4</sub>KHg were prepared
      and characterized. The assertion that a 5-10&deg;C
      temperature difference increases the amount of the
      <em>beta</em> phase was strongly confirmed. However, the
      <em>beta</em> phase can also be formed under nominally
      isothermal intercalation conditions, sometimes even in the
      same ampoule with pure <em>alpha</em>-phase specimens. It
      seems likely that variables that are difficult to control
      precisely (such as the condition of the edges of the graphite
      flake) may affect the speed of the intercalation reaction and
      impact the final ratio of the two phases in a sample. Pure
      <em>beta</em>-phase specimens are never produced, as
      previously noted by Lagrange.[<a href=
      "node11.html#lagrange83">38</a>] Pure <em>alpha</em>-phase
      specimens were routinely produced and found to be pink in
      color, while mixed (<em>alpha</em> + <em>beta</em>) phase
      specimens were variously gold or copper in color.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to derive quantitative structural information from
      the neutron diffraction data, the integrated intensities of
      the diffraction patterns were fit to a 5-layer model[<a href=
      "node11.html#lagrange83a">39</a>] of the unit cell. A
      gradient-least squares optimization algorithm[<a href=
      "node11.html#bevington69">6</a>] was employed to obtain the
      residual-minimizing parameters.[<a href=
      "node11.html#hamilton65">24</a>] The Lorentz factor was
      corrected for the specimen's mosaic spread using a standard
      procedure.[<a href="node11.html#axe83">5</a>] Further details
      of the analysis are given in Ref. [<a href=
      "node11.html#chaiken88">10</a>]. Only the majority
      <em>alpha</em>-phase intensities were fit because the number
      of observed <em>beta</em>-phase peaks was too small. The
      results of the analysis are compared to the parameters
      obtained by previous investigators in <a href=
      "node12.html">Table I</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Careful examination of <a href="node12.html">Table I</a>
      shows that the structural and stoichiometric differences
      between the majority phases of the gold and pink specimens
      are small. The parameters in Table I obtained from the
      structure-factor fits are likewise in good agreement with
      those of Ref. [<a href="node11.html#yang84">60</a>]. In
      conjunction with the results of wet chemical analysis on
      samples whose T<sub>c</sub> was known,[<a href=
      "node11.html#chaiken88">10</a>] the results in <a href=
      "node12.html">Table I</a> contradict the assertion[<a href=
      "node11.html#H242">45</a>,<a href="node11.html#C211">46</a>]
      that the gold mixed-phase C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples are
      mercury-deficient. The general conclusion from the neutron
      diffraction experiments is that the majority-phase material
      in the gold and pink samples appears to be the same. The only
      reproducibly observed difference in the normal-state
      properties of the gold and pink C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples is
      that the gold (T<sub>c</sub> = 0.8 K) samples are
      mixed-phase, while the pink (T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K) samples
      are pure <em>alpha</em> phase. The superconducting properties
      of the single-phase and mixed-phase samples are compared in
      detail below.
