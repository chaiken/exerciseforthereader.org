    </h1>
    <p>
      Several objections may be raised to the type I
      superconductivity hypothesis; firstly, the value of
      H<sub>c</sub> obtained from the t = 0.57
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<em>theta</em>) fit in Fig. 4 (43 gauss) is
      considerably lower than that predicted from the specific heat
      (75 gauss). The ratio between the value of H<sub>c</sub>
      calculated from the specific heat measurements and the
      H<sub>c</sub> obtained from the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<em>theta</em>) fits is about 1.8 for two
      T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K specimens and the three temperatures
      where H<sub>c2</sub>(<em>theta</em>) measurements were
      performed. A second problem with the type I explanation is
      that the H<sub>c2</sub>(<em>theta</em>) data are not
      perfectly flat near <em>theta</em> = 0&deg;, although
      H<sub>c</sub> should be absolutely constant as a function of
      angle. Both of these discrepancies may be caused by
      angle-dependent demagnetization effects, which are hard to
      account for quantitatively.[<a href=
      "node11.html#denhoff82">17</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to extract believable values for H<sub>c</sub> from
      the H<sub>c2</sub>(<em>theta</em>) fits, demagnetization
      corrections need to be applied. The angular dependence of the
      demagnetization factor of an oblate spheroidal superconductor
      has been worked out by Denhoff and Gygax.[<a href=
      "node11.html#denhoff82">17</a>] However, the application of
      this formula to the C<sub>4</sub>KHg data is not justified
      since too many parameters which are poorly known (dimensions
      of the intercalated sample) or not independently known (<img
      width="9" height="8" align="bottom" alt="" src="img33.png" />
      and <em>epsilon</em>) are involved. Therefore the
      demagnetization for the C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples has been
      estimated only for the high-symmetry directions by
      approximating the sample shape as ellipsoidal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The samples used in the H<sub>c2</sub>(<em>theta</em>)
      measurements were flat plates with typical dimensions on the
      order of (2 mm &times; 2 mm &times; 0.5mm). Consultation of
      standard tables[<a href="node11.html#osborn45">43</a>] shows
      that a demagnetization correction of about 3 is anticipated
      for an ellipsoid with radii in the ratios 1:1:0.25 when the
      field is applied along the perpendicular to the smallest
      dimension. If this correction is applied to the H<sub>c</sub>
      values determined from the H<sub>c2</sub>(<em>theta</em>)
      fits, one obtains H<sub>c</sub>(0) <img width="13" height="9"
      align="bottom" alt="" src="img34.png" /> 203 gauss, which is
      now a factor of 1.8 <em>higher</em> than the H<sub>c</sub>(0)
      of 112 gauss calculated from the specific heat data. Since
      <img width="74" height="27" align="middle" alt="" src=
      "img35.png" /> and <img width="75" height="29" align="middle"
      alt="" src="img36.png" />, a higher H<sub>c</sub> for the
      pink T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K specimens implies that they have a
      higher density of states N(0) than the gold specimens, which
      is in keeping with their higher T<sub>c</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that an estimate for the true value of H<sub>c</sub> has
      been obtained, it is interesting to re-examine Fig. 4. <img
      width="28" height="11" align="bottom" alt="" src=
      "img37.png" /> marks the corrected value of the thermodynamic
      critical field at <strong>t</strong> = 0.57. The implication
      of this H<sub>c</sub> estimate is that C<sub>4</sub>KHg is
      type I in the approximate range <em>theta</em> &lt; 80 &deg;,
      and type II for <em>theta</em> &gt; 80 &deg;. Magnetization
      measurements on C<sub>4</sub>KHg are desirable to positively
      identify type I superconductivity. Specific heat measurements
      on T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K pink C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimens
      would also be useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extended linearity of H<sub>c2</sub>(T) reported here for
      T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K pink C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimens is not
      surprising in light of previous studies of layered
      superconductors. Positive curvature or extended linearity of
      H<sub>c2</sub>(T) are phenomena common to almost all
      anisotropic superconducting compounds.[<a href=
      "node11.html#woollam74">59</a>] Depending on the specific
      type of superconductor in question, many different
      explanations might be considered for the anomalous
      temperature dependence of H<sub>c2</sub>. For example,
      mechanisms ranging from coupling-dimensionality crossover[<a
      href="node11.html#klemm75">35</a>] to
      proximity-effect-induced curvature[<a href=
      "node11.html#biagi85">7</a>] to magnetoresistive anomalies[<a
      href="node11.html#delong87">16</a>] have been cited as the
      cause of positive curvature in various superconductors.
      However, each of these esplanations for its own reasons seems
      to be inappropriate for GIC's.[<a href=
      "node11.html#chaiken88">10</a>] In order to choose an
      appropriate model from the many that are available, the best
      procedure is to consider what is already known about GIC's.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two types of models of anisotropic
      superconductivity that seem to contain the right features for
      the GIC superconductors: these are the anisotropic Fermi
      surface models[<a href="node11.html#butler80">8</a>,<a href=
      "node11.html#youngner80">61</a>] and the multiband
      superconductivity models.[<a href=
      "node11.html#entel76">22</a>,<a href=
      "node11.html#M143">2</a>] Anisotropic Fermi surface models
      are an obvious choice because the quasi-2D band structure of
      graphite is responsible for many of the characteristic
      properties of GIC's. The simplest anisotropy-based model
      available is that developed by Butler[<a href=
      "node11.html#butler80">8</a>] to fit H<sub>c2</sub>(T) in Nb.
      This model was adapted by Dalrymple and Prober to fit the
      critical fields of NbSe<sub>2</sub>, which show extended
      linearity and positive curvature[<a href=
      "node11.html#dalrymple84">13</a>] similar to that seen in
      GIC's. The NbSe<sub>2</sub> Fermi surface has cylindrical
      pieces at the hexagonal Brillouin zone boundary, and bears a
      great deal of resemblance to the proposed Fermi surface of
      many of the GIC's.[<a href="node11.html#inoshita77">28</a>,<a
      href="node11.html#divincenzo82">18</a>] The band structure of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg has been calculated,[<a href=
      "node11.html#holzwarth88">27</a>] but unfortunately not
      enough quantitative information about the Fermi surface has
      been reported to allow a detailed comparison between the
      Butler model and the data for C<sub>4</sub>KHg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another well-established feature of the GIC's Fermi surface
      is the presence of multiple bands. Some of the bands at the
      Fermi surface of graphitic origin are nearly two-dimensional
      in character. Other bands, which may be either of intercalant
      or graphitic origin, are more 3D in character. In
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg these 3D bands are derived from hybridized K
      and Hg levels.[<a href="node11.html#holzwarth88">27</a>]
      Models for H<sub>c2</sub>(T) which incorporate the
      participation of two bands in the superconductivity therefore
      appear to be a logical choice for GIC's. Entel and Peter have
      fit H<sub>c2</sub>(T) data for
      Cs<sub>0.1</sub>WO<sub>2.9</sub>F<sub>0.1</sub>, a tungsten
      fluoroxide bronze, using a two-band Fermi surface model.[<a
      href="node11.html#entel76">22</a>] Al-Jishi[<a href=
      "node11.html#aljishi88">3</a>] has proposed a similar model
      specifically tailored to fit critical field data on
      C<sub>8</sub>K, although calculations using this model are
      still preliminary. More theoretical work is needed to
      interpret the large body of critical field data already
      available.[<a href="node11.html#iye82">30</a>,<a href=
      "node11.html#B340">9</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea that both graphitic and intercalant bands
      participate in GIC superconductivity is sensible for two
      reasons. One reason is that there are superconducting GIC's
      (specifically the binary compounds C<sub>8</sub>K (Ref. [<a
      href="node11.html#koike80">37</a>]) and C<sub>8</sub>Rb (Ref.
      [<a href="node11.html#kobayashi85a">36</a>])) which are
      synthesized from non-superconducting starting materials.
      Since the KHg-GIC's are synthesized from KHg amalgams which
      are themselves superconducting, it might be thought that this
      argument for multiband superconductivity is invalid for them.
      However, the increase of T<sub>c</sub> with stage in the
      KHg-GIC's is contrary to expectations of the superconducting
      proximity effect[<a href="node11.html#werthamer63">57</a>,<a
      href="node11.html#degennes66">14</a>] if the carbon layers
      are not also participating in the superconductivity. The
      large critical field anisotropy seen in GIC's is also
      difficult to explain if graphitic electrons are not
      involved.[<a href="node11.html#takada82">49</a>,<a href=
      "node11.html#M143">2</a>] If the graphitic electrons are
      implicated in GIC superconductivity, then it follows that
      speculation about a coupling-dimensionality crossover in
      KHg-GIC's[<a href="node11.html#iye82">30</a>] due to
      decoupling of the intercalant layers is not sensible. If the
      graphitic bounding layers are also superconducting, then it
      may be their separation which will determine a
      coupling-dimensionality change. Considerations of this type
      may be important in discussion of dimensionality change in
      the high-T<sub>c</sub> ceramic superconductors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is reasonable to expect a common origin for the extended
      linearity of H<sub>c2</sub>(T) and the deviations from Eq. 1
      in the H<sub>c2</sub>(<em>theta</em>) fits. However, the
      deviations in H<sub>c2</sub>(T) from the HW theory occur at
      the lowest obtainable reduced temperatures. The
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<em>theta</em>) fits to Eq. 1, on the other
      hand, worsen as the temperature is increased toward
      T<sub>c</sub>.[<a href="node11.html#chaiken88">10</a>]
      Worsening agreement between Eq. 1 and the data as temperature
      is increased is expected if type I superconductivity is the
      origin of the discrepancy. This behavior has already been
      observed for TaN.[<a href="node11.html#weber78">56</a>] All
      the available evidence therefore points to type I
      superconductivity as the explanation of the poor quality of
      the fits shown in Fig. <a href="#pinktheta"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="png" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not necessary to make allowance for type I character
      to fit the H<sub>c2</sub>(<em>theta</em>) curves of the gold,
      mixed-phase samples, a finding which is consistent with the
      observations of Iye and Tanuma.[<a href=
      "node11.html#iye82">30</a>] Type II character for all
      orientations of low-T<sub>c</sub> C<sub>4</sub>KHg is due to
      the fact that the T<sub>c</sub> = 0.8 K samples have critical
      fields almost as high as the T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K samples.
      To be more specific, the typical value of <img width="70"
      height="28" align="middle" alt="" src="img38.png" /> for a
      T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimen is only about
      750 gauss, while that for the T<sub>c</sub> = 0.8 K specimens
      is about 650 gauss.[<a href="node11.html#iye82">30</a>] The
      critical field slope at T<sub>c</sub> in the HW model is
      dH<sub>c2</sub>/ dT , = , 4 k<sub>B</sub> / <em>pi</em> e D,
      where k<sub>B</sub> and e are the usual fundamental constants
      and D = v<sub>F</sub> <em>l</em>/3 is the diffusivity.[<a
      href="node11.html#orlando79">42</a>,<a href=
      "node11.html#saintjames69">47</a>] Therefore the higher
      dH<sub>c2</sub>/dT in the mixed-phase samples suggests that
      they have either a lower mean-free path <em>l</em> or a
      smaller Fermi velocity v<sub>F</sub>. The greater in-plane
      disorder of the mixed-phase samples would appear to favor the
      lower mean-free path explanation.<br />
