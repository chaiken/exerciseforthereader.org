      Figure 1: Schematic of the boron nitride crystal structures.
      The hexagonal (hBN), cubic(cBN), rhombohedral(rBN), and
      wurtzite(wBN) phases of boron nitride are shown with dark
      balls representing boron atoms and white balls representing
      nitrogen. Note that the hexagonal crystal structure has A-B-A
      stacking, while the rBN has A-B-C-A stacking of the
      hexagonal-like sheets. The wurtzite crystal structure can be
      viewed as a distortion of the cubic phase where the
      tetrahedral bonds in one direction are expanded to form a
      layered compound.

      Figure 2: Boron 1s core-level photoabsorption for hBN, cBN,
      rBN, and wBN phases of boron nitride and a BN thin film grown
      by ion-assisted, pulsed laser deposition. Each spectrum was
      photon flux normalized and scaled. Note that the
      pi<sup>*</sup> feature at 192.0 eV that is identified with
      hBN is also present in the rBN and BN/Si samples.

      Figure 3: Nitrogen 1s photoabsorption for the hBN, cBN, rBN,
      wBN, and BN/Si samples presented in Figure 1. Here the
      resonances are not as prominant as those at the B 1s edge,
      however, the relative energy positions and intensities are
      valuable for understanding the atomic distribution for the
      electronic density of states when compared to the
      corresponding B 1s features.<br />
