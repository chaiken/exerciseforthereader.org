      Boron and nitrogen core-level photoabsorption was analyzed
      using the methods described by St&uuml;hr[8] where resonances
      in the NEXAFS are interpreted as transitions from bound,
      localized core-levels with discrete angular-momentum to
      quasi-bound or continuum states. Dipole selection rules,
      which govern these optical transitions, predict allowed
      transitions for 1s initial states into p-like empty final
      states. These p-like final states - or p* states - are
      associated with anti-bonding molecular orbitals or empty
      bands in systems with p-bonding.[18] These empty states are
      predicted for the hexagonal BN 19 , much like structurally
      similar graphite.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Figure 2, the most prominent feature in the B 1s NEXAFS
      spectrum for hBN is the narrow and intense transition at
      192.0 eV. This resonance has been observed and assigned as a
      1s-p* transition in previous photoabsorption
      measurements.[4,20] These p-bond related resonances are
      associated with sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized, planar bonding and
      should be absent in sp<sup>3</sup> tetrahedrally bonded
      materials. In fact, the cubic phase BN with the diamond
      structure pictured in Figure 1 is predicted to have
      sp<sup>3</sup> bonding and should not have any strong
      pi<sup>*</sup> NEXAFS resonances.[19] Figure 2 clearly
      supports this by illustrating that cBN does not exhibit this
      sharp 1s-p<sup>*</sup> resonance at 192.0 eV, but instead has
      an absorption maximum into sigma<sup>*</sup> continuum states
      at 194 eV as its dominant feature. The same conclusion can be
      made for the n-edge results in Figure 3; the feature at 399
      eV for the hBN sample can be attributed to a pi<sup>*</sup>
      resonance and is absent in the cBN NEXAFS. This striking
      difference in the absorption cross section between two phases
      of the same material make NEXAFS measurements a valuable tool
      for better understanding the relationship amongst the
      bonding, atomic, and electronic structure in solids.
    </p>

      The rhombohedral phase of BN is formed by heat treating a
      mixture of NaBH4, NH4CL, and KCN.[10] Its structure (pictured
      in Figure 1) can be viewed as a distortion of the hBN
      structure. Hexagonal BN has A-B-A stacking of hexagonally
      bonded planes, but rBN has A-B-C-A stacking. Because the
      intra-planar bonding/electronic interaction is greater than
      the inter-planar interaction - and the intra-planar bonding
      is identical - for these materials, the B 1s NEXAFS of rBN
      should be similar to that of hBN. In fact, the rBN B 1s
      photoabsorption in Figure 2 exhibits a strong 1s -
      pi<sup>*</sup> resonance indicative of sp2 bonding and is
      nearly identical to the hBN NEXAFS. Using the core-level
      photoabsorption alone, it would be difficult to distinguish
      between the hexagonal and rhombohedral phases of BN. This is
      not surprising because of the nearly identical local bonding
      and chemical environment surrounding each photoabsorber. For
      the nitrogen edges illustrated in Figure 3, a similar
      conclusion can be drawn: there is little to distinguish the
      hexagonal and rhombohedral phases in the NEXAFS structure.
      Again, this can be explained by the dominance of the 1s -
      pi<sup>*</sup> transition in the near-edge structure. As
      mentioned, both phases would have a similar sp<sup>2</sup>,
      conjugated p-bond leading to these resonances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wurtzite BN was formed by a shock compression process[9]
      and has a structure that can be viewed as a distorted cubic
      structure (Figure 1). Qualitatively, this would imply that
      the bonding in this phase of the material would be more
      sp<sup>3</sup> -like than sp<sup>2</sup> and should not have
      quasi-bound p-states. Band calculations predict[19] ample
      dispersion along all three dimensions and supports this
      qualitative view that the bonding in wBN is three dimensional
      - like cBN - and dissimilar to the planar hBN - which has
      little or no electronic-state dispersion along the c-axis of
      the material. This assessment is supported by the B 1s NEXAFS
      in Figure 2. In these data, there is no evidence of the 1s
      -p<sup>*</sup> resonances such as those found in hBN, and the
      edge onset is close to that of sp<sup>3</sup> - bonded cBN
      (194 eV). The resonances present in wBN are similar to those
      found in cBN and can be correlated with 1s -
      sigma<sup>*</sup> transitions. Comparing the B 1s
      photoabsorption structure of cBN and wBN, we observe many
      similarities, which is expected for similarly bonded material
      with the same chemical composition, but near the excitation
      edge there is a more prominent resonance at 196 eV in the wBN
      NEXAFS than in the cBN. This comparison is not as striking as
      the difference between hBN and cBN, but at the edge - and
      between 210 and 216 eV - the dissimilarity is clear.
      Calculations that model the NEXAFS excitation process, and
      take into account the final-state core-hole interaction,
      should be able to model the effects of structural changes on
      the core-level photoabsorption features.[11]
    </p>

      Using the NEXAFS measured from these four phases of BN, we
      can then proceed to qualitatively assess the bonding of the
      BN/Si thin film. Immediately it is evident from the B 1s
      photoabsorption in Figure 2 that the BN/Si sample has the
      strong 1s - pi<sup>*</sup> resonance at 192 eV indicative of
      sp<sup>2</sup> bonding as is observed in the hexagonal phase
      of BN. The same is true for the nitrogen 1s photoabsorption
      edge shown in Figure 3. One difference is noticeable between
      the BN/Si and hBN boron 1s spectra: the resonance at 200 eV
      is more pronounced in the BN/Si film than in the hBN sample.
      In the nitrogen spectrum in Figure 3, the resonance at 407 eV
      is higher than the edge peak for the BN/Si sample, but the
      opposite is true for the hBN sample. One explanation for this
      could be contribution of cubic- phase, or sp<sup>3</sup>
      related, resonances to the NEXAFS. This is supported by
      infrared absorption measurements on this BN/Si film which
      indicate the presence of approximately 15% cBN.[11] While
      there is no unique evidence of cBN in this qualitative
      assessment of the near-edge structure of BN/Si, the NEXAFS
      measurements are useful for determining the sp<sup>2</sup>
      bonding present in the thin film.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our earlier report on using NEXAFS to determine the
      bonding in a BN thin film, we were able to determine that the
      film was mainly sp<sup>2</sup> bonded material, but was not
      entirely amorphous. It was determined through a polarization
      dependent NEXAFS measurement that the BN film was
      preferentially ordered with the BN hexagonal planes lying
      nearly perpendicular to the surface normal (within 20
      degrees). This method of determining the angular orientation
      of the p<sup>*</sup> states in a material has been described
      previously. 17 Our earlier observation of the hBN - like film
      being preferentially oriented with the BN c-axis lying near
      the surface plane was also seen in this film (data not
      shown). This counterintuitive film structure was supported by
      recently published TEM results[21] that show laser ablated BN
      films can have such an oriented hBN-like component. In fact,
      electron diffraction measurements of our film confirm this
      perpendicular stacking of hexagonal BN sheets.[22]
      McKenzie[23] has also suggested that during the growth of
      carbon films in-plane compressive stresses due to ion
      irradiation can cause the c-axis of graphite to orient
      parallel to the substrate surface.
