      Hexagonal, cubic, rhombohedral, and wurtzite boron nitride
      (hBN, cBN, rBN, and wBN, respectively) powders were pressed
      into a Ta foil for introduction into the ultra-high vacuum
      apparatus that was used in the core-level photoabsorption
      measurements. Samples prepared in this fashion were free of
      possible B or N containing contamination, and were less
      susceptible to charging during measurement owing to the
      conductive substrate. The metastable wBN,[9] rBN,[10] and cBN
      powders that would serve as our spectroscopic standards were
      measured using x-ray diffraction to determine the phase
      purity.[11] The cubic material was found to be pure cBN with
      trace metallic impurities, and the rBN and wBN were found to
      be 94 and 93% pure respectively, with the remainder being the
      hexagonal phase source material used in synthesizing these
      two powders. The crystal structures of these materials are
      shown in Figure 1.

      An incoherent BN/Si film (BN/Si) was prepared using
      ion-assisted, pulsed-laser deposition according to procedures
      described previously. [5] The 700&Aring; thick film showed no
      long-range structural ordering as determined from X-ray
      diffraction. This indicates that this film had an amorphous,
      or incoherent structure (i.e., the grain or domain size was
      smaller than the coherence length of the x-ray probe).[12]
      Other spectroscopic studies of this fine-grained film using
      infrared absorption indicate the domain size of the BN films
      are smaller than the phonon wavelength (about 2000&Aring;)
      and confirm the amorphous character of this film. Thin-film
      samples prepared by other methods have produced fine-grained,
      or amorphous films as well.[13]
    </p>

      The boron and nitrogen 1s photoabsorption from each of these
      samples were measured using monochomatized synchrotron
      radiation . These measurements were performed at the IBM/U8
      beam line at the National Synchrotron Light Source[14,15] and
      at the 8-1 and 8-2 beamlines at the Stanford Synchrotron
      Radiation Laboratory.[16] The NEXAFS from each of the BN
      samples was measured in one of two ways: a
      secondary-electron, partial yield mode, and a total-electron
      yield mode. In both modes, nearly identical results were
      obtained. Briefly, to measure the core-level photoabsorption
      cross section the photon energy of monochromatic synchrotron
      radiation is scanned through the core-level edge while
      monitoring the electron yield. In the partial-yield mode, the
      secondary electrons emitted from the samples below 10 eV are
      measured, and in the total-yield mode, all emitted electrons
      are recorded. In both instances the low-energy, long
      mean-free-path electron emission dominates the signal and
      therefore makes the measurements bulk sensitive and surface
      contaminant insensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our earlier report, the boron and nitrogen 1s core-level
      photoemission was measured and it revealed a B:N ratio of 1:1
      in the powders, but was larger for the film. The
      non-stoiciometry of the thin films is typical of rapid,
      non-equilibrium growth conditions.[13] The film made for this
      study was fabricated using a N<sup>+</sup> ion assisted
      growth procedure,[5] and hence, had a B:N ratio close to
      1:1.[11] Charging of our insulating BN powders during
      photoemission reduced the tractable chemical information from
      this method, however, the NEXAFS measurements are much less
      sensitive to charging. The B 1s near-edge photoabsorption for
      the four powders and the BN/Si film is shown in Figure 2. In
      each spectrum the electron yield was normalized to the energy
      and temporal dependent photon flux that was measured during
      the NEXAFS measurement. These spectra were then scaled to the
      largest feature for comparison purposes. Similar procedures
      were used to prepare the N 1s photoabsorption data presented
      in Figure 3. For each measurement, the sample normal was 54o
      with respect to the synchrotron radiation polarization
      vector, thereby averaging out any angle-dependence to the
      absorption intensity.[17]
