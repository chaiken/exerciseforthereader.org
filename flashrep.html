    <h3>
      Flash market overview
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are two main markets for flash: code storage (cell
      phones, palmtops) and data storage (mp3 players, cameras).
      Right now cell phones dominate the flash market, but data
      storage applications are coming on strong. The flash market
      is growing at a 35% CAGR every year, and should reach 20 B$
      by 2004. (Source: Semico.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cell phones</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1999, cell phones accounted for 27% of the flash market,
      with digital cameras (the application most visible to
      consumers) accounting for only 2%. By 2004, e-books, music
      players, set-top boxes and GPS are all expected to be major
      consumers of flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cell phone usage is growing at a CAGR of 30%. There will be
      10<sup>9</sup> users by 2003. Computers and phones now fall
      on a continuous spectrum, with hybrid devices growing in
      importance. This convergence presents new opportunities for
      memory. With 3rd generation cell phones, expected in a few
      years, 2 Mb/s data rates are expected, meaning that
      transmission of video will be possible. Obviously this has
      data storage implications. In 2004, entry-level phones will
      have 32 Mb of storage, but "smart" phones will have as much
      as 0.5 Gb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The US is behind in consumer adoption of cell phones, so we
      tend to be unaware of how far this revolution has already
      gone. Cell phones are commonly used as "electronic wallets"
      in Finland, where sodas can commonly be purchased from
      vending machines via cell phone using a technology jointly
      developed by Nokia and Visa. In Japan, sending friends
      digital still images is a common use of phones. [Visions of
      Cooltown.] A 35 gram phone the size of two side-by-side
      pencils is now available in Japan.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the storage vendor point of view, the good news is that
      the incorporation of flash into phones is now limited by the
      cost of flash, not the phone manufacturer's need for memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>MP3 Players</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Music players are an example of flash usage for data storage.
      Market analysts anticipate a 100% CAGR for music player sales
      through 2003, reaching 8-16M units/year. In 2000, it is
      expected that 3.7M mp3 players will be sold. These unit
      volumes sound paltry, but "MP3 players are essentially just
      wrappers for flash. They have a very high silicon content."
      In 2000, players will typically have 64 MB of memory,
      accounting for 75% of the cost. Magnetic storage is not
      viable for MP3 players, which require rugged, low-power
      storage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Digital cameras</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      For a typical digital camera, 10% of the purchase price is in
      flash. 8.8M units were sold in 2000. Magnetic storage is
      poised to recapture this market, since cameras themselves are
      neither rugged nor low-power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though MP3 players and other data storage applications
      of flash have small unit sales, they should represent half
      the market by 2003.
    </p>
    <h3>
      The flash industry
    </h3>
    <p>
      The top 5 manufacturers of flash in 1999 (in order) were
      Intel, AMD, Fujitsu, Sharp and Atmel. The first four of these
      sold identical products. All 5 of these sold flash
      specialized for code storage (common-ground NOR
      architecture).
    </p>
    <p>
      The 6th and 7th vendors of flash were Toshiba and Samsung.
      They sell flash specialized for data storage applications,
      and have been moving up the list. ST Microelectronics was
      eighth.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Flash Technologies
    </h3>
    <p>
      For code storage applications, read speed is all-important,
      since users will never load new code. For data storage
      applications, write speed is all-important. These customer
      needs determine the design of flash devices. Right now
      "common-ground NOR" devices for code storage represent 75% of
      total flash sales. cgNOR is optimized for write speed and can
      be extended to a multi-level cell (MLC). The most common
      architecture for data storage is NAND-based. NAND is denser
      than cgNOR and faster at writing, but it is not extensible to
      a MLC design. [I got the distinct impression that cgNOR is
      Intel's propietary standard and that a competitor has
      developed NAND, but I could be wrong about this.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now cell sizes are scaling down at a CAGR of 32%/year.
      This means a 65%/year CAGR for product total capacity. Cell
      sizes have been halving every two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Problems with scaling ("Roadbumps")</strong>
    </p>
    <ul class="noindent">
      <li>Oxide thickness scaling limit
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The gate oxide dielectrics in flash elements must be
      susceptible to tunneling when you want to write, but must be
      impermeable to leakage at other times. Contacts and other
      insulating elements in flash have scaled well during the
      15-year history of the technology, but these non-transistor
      elements are now such a small part of the real estate that
      the transistor itself will have to be scaled soon. Once the
      transistor is scaled, the gate oxide thickness will have to
      be scaled too. (This is always true of CMOS.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1985 when flash was introduced, the gate oxide thickness
      was 115 Å when the cell size was 1.5 µm. Now the oxide
      thickness is 95Å at 0.18 µm.
    </p>
    <ul class="noindent">
      <li>Channel hot carrier electron limit
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Channel hot carrier electrons are a second way to program
      flash. However, the hot carrier method requires a 4-5 V power
      supply and the tunneling method requires 15-20 V. The high
      voltage circuitry at the edge of the die is difficult to
      integrate with the flash cells. [? It wasn't clear why this
      was so.]
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past, flash designers have often solved problems by
      adopting solutions that CPU designers have developed.
      However, the two problems described above are unique to
      flash, so the CPU developers are not going to save flash
      designers this time.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Predictions
    </h3>
    <ul class="noindent">
      <li>Multi-level cells (MLC) will become prevalent.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Within 5-6 years, 2 bits/cell (2b/c, which is already
      available) will give way to 4 bits/cell (4b/c). Going to MLCs
      is easier than continuing scaling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future, some products will mix 2b/c (high-reliability)
      with 4b/c (cheap, high-density).
    </p>
    <p>
      Flash is intrinsically an analog memory scheme, since the
      data is stored as charge on a gate. This is in contrast to
      SRAM, where the flip-flop can really only be in one of two
      stable states.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two-bit cells, the state of the device is read out as the
      threshold voltage [presumably the threshold for tunnel
      current]. The threshold varies between 2.5 and 6 V for a
      two-bit cell, with these values representing 00 and 11. 01
      and 10 are represented by intermediate discrete threshold
      values. Two-bit cells are only 5% larger in area than an
      array of 1-bit cells, meaning that 2b/c gives about a
      1-scaling-generation increase in density without cell-size
      reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      2b/c has a 10<sup>5</sup> cycles endurance, a 6 µS write
      time, and a 120 nS read time. These specs are almost as good
      as typical cgNOR devices, so 2b/c comes with little
      performance cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      ST Microelectronics has announced a 4b/c demo. At this
      density, performance is truly degraded and compromises must
      be made. [Is there an opportunity for quantum devices here?
      Certain solid-state systems, most obviously the quantum hall
      effect, give well-defined, stable threshold voltages. Not
      obvious how to make this into a memory, though!]
    </p>
    <p>
      At the 4b/c level, a 1 Gb flash memory will be possible in
      the current form factor with 0.18 µm linewidths.
    </p>
    <ul class="noindent">
      <li>Flash will be increasingly integrated with logic chips,
      especially in cell phones.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      [This argument struck me as Intel special pleading. They are
      famous for wanting to leverage their CPU leadership into
      domination of other IC markets, and this integration plan
      seems to fit in with their other world-domination schemes. Of
      course, that doesn't mean that the performance argument for
      integration isn't compelling.]
    </p>
    <p>
      A cell phone = radio + signal processing + computer + memory.
      Which should be integrated first? Right now cell phones have
      40 ICs, but Atwood predicts they will have 5 by 2004.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best integration is flash + logic since that eliminates
      the need for a bus. Buses waste lots of power, so their
      elimination is desirable. This integration should be
      accomplished by 2003.
    </p>
    <ul class="noindent">
      <li>Magnetic storage continues to play a role in portables.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The demise of magnetic storage in the handheld market has
      been widely predicted, but Atwood expects that it will hang
      on in products like cameras, where ruggedness and low power
      consumption don't matter as much.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Questions from the floor
    </h3>
    <ul class="noindent">
      <li>Q: What is the acceptable error rate for MP3 players?
      What error rate does 2b/c flash achieve?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A: The great thing about MP3 is that data archivability and
      error rate are relatively unimportant. In this application,
      users won't use up their 10<sup>5</sup> cycles, nor do they
      care about a few bit errors here and there. Furthermore,
      since users will want to rewrite their storage frequently (no
      listening to the same music over and over), years of storage
      reliability doesn't matter. However, at 4b/c, even MP3
      players may need error correction codes, which they don't
      have now.
    </p>
    <ul class="noindent">
      <li>Q: What accounts for the shape of the number-of-devices
      vs. threshold voltage histogram plot?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      [In the histogram plot, the 00 and 11 peaks for a 2b/c cell
      were very broad, showing a rather unpredicable threshold
      voltage, while the 10 and 01 peaks were narrow.]
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Right now flash products automatically do error checking
      as part of the writing algorithm. The controller will write
      the bits to a location, then check the threshold voltage. If
      the voltage is not in range (that is, is not readily
      distinguishable from a state differing by 1 bit), then the
      controller will rewrite the bit until it is in range. The
      controller doesn't bother to do this for the 00 and 11 (2b/c)
      or 0000 and 1111 (4b/c) cells, since these endpoint values
      need only be above or below certain levels, not within a
      certain range.
    </p>
    <ul class="noindent">
      <li>Q: Might novel dielectrics solve the flash transistor
      scaling problem?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A: Dielectrics for flash must be good both for charge storage
      (like traditional dielectrics) and for tunneling. It's hard
      for a new dielectric material to compete with SiO<sub>x</sub>
      on both these accounts. There are good reasons why ­100 Å of
      SiO<sub>x</sub> has been used for 15 years.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Summary
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Flash was a $4B industry in 1999.
      </li>
      <li>The industry is mature, in that new cell designs are no
      longer appearing.
      </li>
      <li>Scaling challenges are coming up soon.
      </li>
      <li>Multi-level cells are the best way around oxide thickness
      problems.
