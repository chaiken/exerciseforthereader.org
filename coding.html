			  Special Session at ICC 2001
		   Signal Processing and Coding for Storage
		      Helsinki, Finland June 11-15, 2001


SUBMISSION DEADLINE SEPTEMBER 1, 2000
This session will cover signal processing and coding techniques for magnetic
and optical storage systems, including disk and tape channels. Suggested topics
for original technical papers include:

   o Channel characterization and modeling, including media noise and
     non-linearities
   o Detection methods, including sequence detection, partial response and
     decision feedback
   o Equalization and filtering, including non-linear techniques
   o Modulation and run-length limited codes, trellis coding and equalization
   o Error-correction codes and turbo codes applied to storage systems
   o Read/write channel integrated circuits
   o Signal processing for optical storage systems: holographic, near-field,
     multi-level, phase change, MO, CD, DVD
   o Coding bounds and channel capacity
   o Storage density and read/write data rate: limitations and issues
     surrounding head/media/preamplifier/channel/servo/host interface
   o Write pre-compensation and write equalization
   o Timing and gain recovery
   o Signal processing for servo: spin control, actuator, demodulation, and
     Gray code detection
   o Cost versus performance issues surrounding design of signal processing
     systems for storage
   o Special issues surrounding signal processing and coding for removable
     storage devices

Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers for this session following
the electronic submission guidelines (see accompanying ICC 2001 Call for
Papers). Only electronic submissions will be accepted this year. The initial
submission deadline is September 1, 2000. In addition to the copies
electronically submitted to the ICC 2001 TPC Chair, please e-mail one copy of
the paper to the session organizer listed below. Please make a note in your
e-mail and on the title page that the paper is intended for the 'Signal
Processing and Coding for Storage' session.
