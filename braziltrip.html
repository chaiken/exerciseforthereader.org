    <h1>
      Account of Our 10-Day Trip around Brazil
    </h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.wsrcc.com/wolfgang/">Wolfgang</a> and I
      went for a 10-day long trip around Brazil following the
      <a href="http://www.iccmp.br/mag-iti.html">conference</a> I
      attended at the <a href="http://www.iccmp.br/">International
      Center for Condensed Matter Physics</a> at the <a href=
      "http://www.unb.br">University of Brasilia.</a> Our travel
      arrangements were made by Robert at Brazil Reservation
      System, (800) 544-5503.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Rio de Janeiro
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the first several days we hung out in Rio on the beach. I
      knew Wolfgang would be jet-lagged, so I figured suntanning
      would be a relatively untaxing introduction to South America
      for him. We stayed at the Leme Palace Hotel, on the beach at
      the northern end of Copacabana. The <em>location, location,
      location</em> of this hotel was excellent, but it was a bit
      rundown; we got bitten by fleas and everything needed a coat
      of paint. The view from the seaside balcony was outstanding:
      Cariocas playing futbol, having bonfires, surfing, and just
      in general raging. The hotel room cost $119 per night. The
      first day we walked along the Copacabana beach and drank
      beer. Vendors sell beer on the beach: cool! If I were Al
      Gore, I'd run on a "A Beer on Every Beach" campaign in 2000
      (but that's why I'm not Al Gore). The beach is remarkably
      beautiful, even compared to the <a href=
      "lostcoast.html">Northern California coast</a>. It's hard to
      believe that the granite promontories all around are real
      having been to Las Vegas and Disneyland. We live in the San
      Francisco, CA Bay Area, and I must say that Rio is the only
      more scenic city in the world. The lagoons, cliffs, hills,
      promontories, beaches and views are more stunning than SF. We
      had a great time watching the locals playing futbol and
      tableless tennis on the beach. (No frisbees!) We got horribly
      sunburned, something which negatively affected the rest of
      our trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second day we walked fully clad all the way south to
      Ipanema. Remarkably Ipanema is even more beautiful than
      Copacabana. From Ipanema you have an excellent view of
      Corcovado, where the giant Christ statue is. To walk to
      Ipanema from Copacabana you travel through Arpoador, a major
      surfing beach with excellent views to both the north and the
      south. There is a fenced-in stray cat sanctuary in Arpoador;
      the rest of the city is obviously ruled by stray dogs. Also
      in Ipanema we went to a crafts fair where really attractive
      leather bean-bag chairs were on sale for $100 each without
      filling. Put off by the price (and effort of hauling 'em
      back), we didn't buy any. If you know a stateside source,
      please do <a href=

      The first rule of travel in Brazil is that all roads lead to
      Sao Paulo. You can go anywhere you want as long as you fly to
      Sao Paulo first. Given that we had a Brazil Airpass and
      traveled around Brazil a bit, we saw <strong>a lot</strong>
      of the Sao Paulo airport. Travel in Brazil is limited by the
      fact that there are typically only a few flights per day
      between most of the major cities, so your itinerary on a
      short trip will be strongly impacted by available flight
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      My overall reaction to the trip was that it was a lot of fun,
      but more expensive than I'd expected. Despite the current
      strength of the dollar, it cost me $21 to do my own laundry
      at a Brazilian laundromat and the best rate we got for a cab
      to the hotel in Rio was $38. I'd do this trip again in a
      second, but I'd take along more money the next time! Between
      the two of us, we took along about $900 in cash, and we
      brought back less than $100. This is despite the fact that
      all our lodging and air transportation were prepaid. There
      can be no doubt that we would have had more fun on this trip
      had we taken along $2000 and been less worried about running
      out of money.
