    <p>
      <a href="fig2.html">Figure 2</a> shows that H<sub>s</sub> for
      the t<sub>Cr</sub> =16&Aring; MBE-grown sandwich increases by
      0.48 kOe between 300 K and 77 K. A previous FMR study of
      single Fe films grown on GaAs found that
      K<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>s</sub> increases by about 0.06 kOe when
      T decreases from 300 to 77 K.[7] Assuming that
      K<sub>1</sub>(T) is similar for the Fe-Cr sandwiches grown on
      ZnSe epilayers, the change of K<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>s</sub>
      with temperature can account for only a 0.12 kOe increase in
      H<sub>s</sub> from 300 K to 77 K. Therefore the increase of
      H<sub>s</sub>(T) in the MBE-grown samples, while coming
      partly from the temperature dependence of
      K<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>s</sub>, is dominated by
      A<sub>12</sub>(T), just as in the polycrystalline and
      superlattice samples. Currently, efforts are underway to
      determine A<sub>12</sub>(T) and K<sub>1</sub>(T)
      independently by fitting the H<sub>J</sub>(T) and
      H<sub>s</sub>(T) data of <a href="fig2.html">Figure 2</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temperature dependence of the magnetoresistance in the
      Fe-Cr sandwiches is more complex. Like H<sub>s</sub>, Dr/r
      has two terms, one arising from the intrinsic anisotropy of
      the Fe layers, and another arising from effects related to
      the interlayer electron transport.[8] The Fe-layer
      contribution, which is known as the anisotropic
      magnetoresistance (AMR), is about the same size as in bulk
      Fe.[8] The AMR is a sinusoidal function of the angle between
      H and I. It is the second term, however, which is responsible
      for the anomalously large magnetoresistance reported in Ref.
      2. This anomalous contribution, which has been called the
      spin-valve magnetoresistance, depends only on the relative
      orientation of the Fe moments, and not on their absolute
      orientation.[9] Therefore, the spin-valve magnetoresistance
      should be isotropic with respect to the applied field
      orientation. This fact allows one to separate the AMR and
      spin-valve contributions to the H||I and H perpendicular to I
      data of <a href="fig3.html">Figure 3(b)</a>: the AMR is the
      difference between the H||I and H perpendicular to I traces,
      while the spin-valve component is half the sum of the two
      data sets. The temperature dependences of the separate AMR
      and spin-valve terms are shown in <a href="fig4.html">Figure
      4</a>. The AMR is nearly constant with temperature, but the
      spin-valve part of the magnetoresistance, while constant
      below about 70 K, has a linear decrease at higher
      temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barthelemy et al. have suggested that the decrease of the
      magnetoresistance with increasing temperature is due in part
      to spin-wave scattering.[2] Interlayer spin fluctuations
      could also be responsible for the linear decrease of
      A<sub>12</sub> with T. In this regard it is relevant to point
      out that Dr, the field-induced change in resistivity, is
      itself a function of temperature. The temperature dependence
      of the spin-valve effect is therefore not just a trivial
      consequence of the temperature variation of the resistivity.
      The data shown in <a href="fig4.html">Figure 4</a> thus
      contain real information about the scattering processes
      responsible for the spin-valve magnetoresistance. At the
      present time, however, the true nature of these scattering
      processes remains unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are still many unanswered questions about the Fe-Cr
      system. For example, <a href="table1.html">Table I</a> shows
      that the magnitude of the magnetoresistance in the Fe-Cr
      sandwiches does not appear to be correlated with either the
      residual resistivity ratio or A<sub>12</sub>. Nonetheless,
      significant progress has been made towards understanding the
      antiferromagnetic exchange and giant magnetoresistance of the
      Fe-Cr superlattices and sandwiches.[3,4,5] The linearity of
      the temperature dependence of the antiferromagnetic exchange
      and spin-valve magnetoresistance should prove helpful in
      understanding the role of spin waves and spin-flip scattering
      in the Fe-Cr system.
