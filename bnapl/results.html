      The B and N 1s core-level photoabsorption spectra are shown
      in <a href="fig1.html">Figure 1</a>. Angle-dependent spectra
      were measured on the iBN thin-film by rotating the samples
      with respect to the incident x-ray beam linear polarization.
      The measurement geometry is illustrated in the inset to <a
      href="fig2.html">Figure 2</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the analysis methods described by St&scaron;hr and
      Outka,[4] the hBN, cBN, and iBN B and N 1s (Figure 1(a) and
      (b)) NEXAFS spectra have been normalized to the background at
      185 eV predicated on the fact that the secondary electron
      yield well below the continuum excitation threshold should be
      angle- independent. The most striking feature of the B 1s
      spectra is the well-defined peak near 192.0 eV measured from
      the hBN sample. Previous work[7,8] has identified the narrow
      feature at 192.0 eV to be an excitation from the 1s initial
      state to a quasi-bound pi<sup>*</sup> final state. Similar
      features have been seen in the spectra of adsorbed organic
      species with p-conjugated bonds.[4] The strong
      1s-pi<sup>*</sup> empty-band resonance is absent in the cBN,
      as anticipated. The broad series of features above 194 eV in
      the cBN spectrum correspond to transitions to
      sigma<sup>*</sup> final states or shape resonances and and
      are consistent with the expected sp3 bonding of this
      material. The iBN B 1s spectrum exhibits a sharp peak that
      can be clearly identified as a pi<sup>*</sup> resonance.
      Thus, these measurements provide strong spectroscopic
      evidence that the iBN thin-film is comprised of sp2- bonded
      boron and nitrogen. Close examination of the broad
      pi<sup>*</sup> peak in the iBN sample shows that it is
      actually a manifold of four partially resolved components.[9]
    </p>
    <p>
      The normal incidence N1s spectra for the three BN specimens
      are displayed in <a href="fig1.html">Figure 1(b)</a>. The
      pi<sup>*</sup> and sigma<sup>*</sup> portions of the spectra
      are less distinct than at the B 1s edge, but overall the same
      qualitative statements hold as for <a href="fig1.html">Figure
      1(a)</a>: the pi<sup>*</sup> peak dominates the hBN and iBN
      spectra, but is absent in the N 1s spectrum measured from the
      cBN sample, which exhibits only the large, broad
      sigma<sup>*</sup> absorption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earlier work identified the pi<sup>*</sup> and
      sigma<sup>*</sup> resonances of pyrolitic BN and then
      determined the alignment of crystallites in hBN by examining
      the angular dependence of the B 1s -pi<sup>*</sup>
      features.[7,8] According to dipole selection rules, the
      matrix element should have a cosine-squared dependence on the
      angle between the bond and the electric field vector.[4] The
      B 1s spectra measured from the iBN sample at various incident
      polar angles q are shown in <a href="fig2.html">Figure 2</a>.
      As can easily be seen, the pi<sup>*</sup> resonance intensity
      has a strong angle dependence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The angle-dependent photoabsorption data of <a href=
      "fig2.html">Figure 2</a> depicts a more intense
      pi<sup>*</sup> resonance near normal incidence (q = 0&deg;)
      than near grazing incidence (q = 90&deg;). This result is
      surprising because it suggests that the atomic p orbitals
      that constitute the p bonds and the associated BN c-axis lie
      preferentially in the plane of the film for this incoherent
      specimen. In order to quantitatively determine the
      orientation of the p bonds, integrated intensities were
      computed from non-linear least squares fits to the B 1s
      pi<sup>*</sup> spectra using the convolution of a Lorentzian
      lineshape with a fixed 65 meV Gaussian for each peak in the
      case of the NSLS data and 320 meV in case of the SSRL data.
      The Gaussian broadening reflects the core-hole lifetime,
      solid-state effects, and instrumental broadening
      contributions to the line shape. Details will be published
      elsewhere.[9]
    </p>
    <p>
      The angular dependence of these integrated intensities is
      shown in <a href="fig3.html">Figure 3</a>, along with two
      sinusoidal curves for comparison. An ideal fit to the cos2q
      angular dependence would indicate that the hexagonal planes
      lie orthogonal to the plane of the film. While this
      orientation seems unlikely, recently electron- diffraction
      measurements on hBN films fabricated by ion plating have
      indicated that the hexagonal planes are oriented near normal
      to the surface of the film.[10] The cos2(q - 20&iexcl;) curve
      actually fits the data better, as the figure shows. Azimuthal
      rotation of the iBN film has shown no evidence for in-plane
      preferential orientation, which eliminates the possibility
      that that the layer planes are simply tilted 20&iexcl; away
      from the interface normal. While possible mosaic spread of
      the crystal can broaden the angular dependence of the
      intensity, it cannot explain the occurrence of the maximum at
      q &sup1; 0&iexcl;. The simplest explanation of the intensity
      maximum at q &raquo; 20&iexcl; is that some part of the film
      has differently oriented hexagonal planes.
