    <p>
      The growth of hBN in small crystallites with the hexagonal
      planes oriented normal to the substrate interface was
      unexpected since one expects thin films to grow in a
      close-packed orientation to minimize the number of
      undercoordinated atoms. However, this result is less
      surprising if one considers that the conditions used to
      prepare this sample are only slightly different from those
      used to grow the metastable cubic phase.[3] Recent work has
      shown that small variations in substrate temperature, laser
      fluence, ion fluence, and gas pressure will produce BN thin
      films of hexagonal, cubic, or incoherent structure.[6]
      McKenzie has suggested that in-plane compressive stress due
      to ion bombardment during growth may orient the
      highly-compressible c-axis parallel to the surface.[10]
      Further work will be necessary to elucidate the relationship
      between substrate temperature, stress, and ion bombardment in
      order to test this hypothesis.

      NEXAFS has been measured on the cubic, hexagonal and
      incoherent forms of boron nitride. B 1s and N1s absorption
      edge data measured from the hBN phase sample clearly shows
      both pi<sup>*</sup> and sigma<sup>*</sup> features, revealing
      the expected sp<sup>2</sup> bonding, while the cBN sample
      shows only the sigma<sup>*</sup> manifold, indicative of
      sp<sup>3</sup> bonding. Boron and nitrogen 1s photoabsorption
      was also measured from a thin film of iBN on Si. Direct
      comparison to the hBN and cBN NEXAFS spectra clearly
      indicated sp<sup>2</sup> bonding in the iBN film because of
      the prominent pi<sup>*</sup> absorption feature. The angular
      dependence of the integrated intensity of the B 1s
      pi<sup>*</sup> absorption for the iBN film shows
      microcrystalline hexagonal layer planes which are oriented
      normal to the film surface, contrary to the usual growth mode
      of hBN. The observation of a preferred bond order in an
      apparently disordered film demonstrates the power of the
      NEXAFS technique to resolve structural features in
      microcrystalline samples.

      The authors would like to thank C.A. Taylor II for help with
      film preparation and G.D. Waddill and R.H. Howell for helpful
      discussions about the data analysis. This work was conducted
      under the auspices of the US Department of Energy by the
      Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract No.
      W-7405-ENG-48, and was performed at the National Synchrotron
      Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory and at Stanford
      Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, which are both supported by
      the Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences.
