    <p>
      Nonvolatile Electronics' NVS5B15 sensors were employed for
      this project.[NVE, 1994] NVE is at present the only
      commercial vendor of GMR sensors, although other electronics
      companies (for example, Honeywell and Motorola) are expected
      to offer GMR products in the next few years. GMR sensors
      detect a single vector component of an applied field, like
      Hall generators or pulsed inductive detectors, so three
      orthogonal sensors banks will be necessary for full 3D
      imaging capability. A single 2D array of sensors was selected
      for this demonstration where alternate sensors have
      orthogonal axes of sensitivity. The checkerboard layout of
      the 5x5 array of sensors is illustrated in <a href=
      "fig2.html">Figure 2</a>. In order to simplify interpretation
      of the magnetic images at the end of the report, the outputs
      from the sensors with vertical and horizontal axes of
      sensitivity are displayed separately, as illustrated on the
      right side of the drawing. The performance of the 5x5 sensor
      array has been compared with a 3x3 array (not shown) where
      all the elements have the same vertical axis of sensitivity.
      The 3x3 array uses the same printed circuit board layout as
      the 5x5 so that the effect of varying the sensor spacing by a
      factor of two could be determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      A schematic of the imaging system is shown in <a href=
      "fig3.html">Figure 3</a>. The sensor arrays were interfaced
      with an electronics chassis that contained a 15V and 5V power
      supply. The outputs of the sensors were connected to a
      National Instruments 64-channel data acquisition card which
      was installed in a Pentium PC. National Instruments' LabView
      software was used to acquire the images that follow. The
      images are unprocessed beyond resizing and adjustment of the
      grayscale for printability. Since there are only 25 sensors
      per image, the data files are only 400 bytes (25 sensors x 16
      bits per sensor) in size. Each image is an average of 1000
      readouts of the full array during a 10-second period
      (acquisition rate = 100 Hz), although there is no reason that
      data could not be acquired much more rapidly (10-100 kHz).
      1000 readouts of the array was decidedly overkill; images
      were not degraded by the averaging of smaller data sets.

      A variety of ferrous objects were imaged. These included
      tools, bolts, nails, rebar and permanent magnets. All objects
      were imaged in their remanent magnetic state (i.e., no
      external applied field) except where otherwise specifically
      noted. Before an image was acquired, the no-object output of
      all the sensors was obtained using the PC. This background
      signal represents a combination of offsets in the sensors,
      the sensors' response to the earth's field (no magnetic
      shielding was used) and their response to magnetic objects in
      the laboratory where the data was acquired, e.g. rebar in the
      floor. This background signal was saved to a file and then
      subtracted from subsequent data. Objects to be imaged were
      placed typically 1.5 cm above the sensor array on a lexan
      stand. The falloff of the signal from the array with
      separation was studied by stacking firebricks between the
      array and the ferrous object. Larger objects such as rebar
      could be detected at a meter separation (signal:background
      ratio of 2:1) although there was no real image at that
      separation with the 12cm-square array used for this
      demonstration.
