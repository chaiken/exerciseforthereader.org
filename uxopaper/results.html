    <p>
      A sampling of images produced with the GMR sensor array is
      shown in <a href="figures.html">Figures 4-7</a>. <a href=
      "fig4.html">Figure 4</a> shows an image of a #10 threaded rod
      1.5 cm above the array, as pictured in the top-view drawing
      on the right. The two gray-scale images on the left are data
      obtained from the sensor array. The top image shows data from
      the GMR elements (labelled "corners") with a vertical axis of
      sensitivity. In the "corners" image, a value of 0 volts is
      displayed at the positions corresponding to the elements with
      a horizontal axis of sensitivity. The bottom image, labelled
      "others," shows data from the GMR elements with a horizontal
      axis of sensitivity. In the "others" image, the positions
      corresponding to the "corners" elements are displayed as 0
      volts. Comparison with <a href="fig2.html">Figure 2</a> will
      clarify which pixels are meaningful in the two images. In a
      real UXO detection system, more sophisticated software would
      combine the two images in a contour or vector plot. Here
      darker grays indicate higher magnetic flux, while lighter
      grays indicate lower magnetic flux. The scale is on the right
      of each image. The numbers next to the grayscale are the
      sensor signal in volts, so that 1.4e-2 means 14 mV of signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the top image of <a href="fig4.html">Figure 4</a>, the
      magnetic poles on the ends of the rod are being picked up by
      the sensors at the upper right and lower left corners. In the
      bottom image, the sensors are responding to magnetic flux
      leaking from the sides of the rod. While the characteristics
      of the rod are not completely clear with this low spatial
      resolution, its general shape and size of the rod can readily
      be determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="fig5.html">Figure 5</a> shows another image of the
      same rod, only this time flipped over so that it is pointing
      towards the opposite corners of the array. The movement of
      the magnetic poles to the upper left and lower right corners
      is obvious in both images. There are several reasons why this
      image is not a perfect mirror of <a href="fig4.html">Figure
      4</a>, namely different lateral placement of the rod on the
      array and different rotation of the rod about its own axis.
      The magnetic domains in the rod may not be azimuthally
      symmetric, with the result that the image may depend somewhat
      on which side of the rod is facing downward. The rod in <a
      href="fig5.html">Figure 5</a> is also oriented differently
      with respect to the earth's field than in <a href=
      "fig4.html">Figure 4</a>. In a real UXO system possible
      ambiguity created by different remanent states of objects can
      be addressed through application of a rotating
      alternating-current magnetic field created by two orthogonal
      sets of coils. A field large enough to force magnetic poles
      on each surface of a permeable object will make each surface
      visible to the GMR array, which is in essence a magnetic edge
      detector.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="fig6.html">Figure 6</a> now shows an image of the
      same rod in a constant 6 Oe external applied field which was
      generated with air-core Helmholtz coils. Before acquiring the
      image, the background of the array was characterized in the
      presence of the 6 Oe field. The most striking part about this
      image is that it looks much like <a href="fig4.html">Figure
      4</a>, showing that the GMR sensor array is able to image
      ferrous objects even in the presence of a substantial
      background magnetic field (about fifteen times the earth's
      field). The reason for the similarity of the two images is
      that the array detects spatial magnetic field variations, not
      the scalar magnetic field amplitude like a cesium-vapor
      magnetometer. <a href="fig4.html">Figure 4</a> supports the
      assertion that array-based detectors will usable with
      magnetic soils as long as the ground clutter is reasonably
      homogeneous on the length scale of the objects to be
      detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another point about <a href="fig6.html">Figure 6</a> is that
      the image is a bit clearer than in <a href="fig4.html">Figure
      4</a>, where no external field is applied. The improved image
      quality occurs because much of the flux from the applied
      field passes through the magnetically soft rod. A more
      complete outline of the rod could be made by acquiring
      another image with an applied field in the orthogonal
      in-plane direction. In fact, a real UXO system would likely
      incorporate 3 sensor arrays, each with a different orthogonal
      axis of sensitivity. Data would be read out from each array
      while a coil applying a magnetic field along that direction
      is energized. A fully realized system would incorporate a
      rotating magnetic field and synchronous acquisition from the
      3 orthogonal arrays. An additional group of 3 sensors could
      be used with a portable GMR detector to eliminate noise due
      to motion of the detector in the earth's magnetic field.
      (Such a noise-elimination scheme has recently been described
      for a fluxgate vector magnetometer system by Allen et
      al.[Allen, 1996])
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="fig7.html">Figure 7</a> illustrates the ability of
      the array to image slightly more complex objects. Here two
      bolts have been placed 1.5 cm above the array. The "corners"
      image shows substantial flux from the threaded part of the
      bolt, while the "others" image shows a more difficult to
      interpret pattern of flux possibly arising from complex
      domain patterns in the bolt head. The overall "V" symmetry of
      the objects is apparent in both images. The image of the two
      bolts would be greatly improved by application of a rotating
      external field and by a higher resolution array, with more
      pixels on each object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another study was done to follow the evolution of images as a
      magnetized object (here a length of 3/4" rebar rod) is moved
      away from the array. When the rebar was close to the array,
      it blinded the detector, saturating most of the sensors. As
      the rebar was moved from 1.5 cm to 9 cm separation, the
      signal level was reduced from 280 mV to 210 mV, still well
      above the typical background level of 20-50 mV. The two
      images at different separation (not shown) demonstrate that
      we have an object with a vertical axis of symmetry. The image
      formed by the sensors with their axis of sensitivity parallel
      to the rebar axis has the same qualitative features
      independent of spacing. In contrast, the image with the
      orthogonal axis of sensitivity varies dramatically as a
      function of spacing. This variation is due to different
      spatial falloff of the various multipole components of the
      magnetization pattern. One must keep in mind that the
      magnetic field emanating from an object can vary in all three
      dimensions, and there is no particular reason in the absence
      of an external applied field for the symmetry of a 2D slice
      taken at one height to be exactly the same as a 2D slice
      taken at another height. On the other hand, the images
      sometimes appear rather simple, as in <a href=
      "fig4.html">Figure 4</a>. Intelligent synthesis of data and
      interpretation of images will be the major challenge in
      building a useful GMR-based UXO detector, although the
      intrinsic difficulty is not greater than in time-domain
      analysis of pulsed electromagnetic induction data, for
      example.
