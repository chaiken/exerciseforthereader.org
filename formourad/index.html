<h1><p align="center">X-Ray Diffraction Data on Recent Corvallis
InSe/GaSe Films</p></h1>

<p align="center"><b>
<a href="mailto:chaiken@hpl.hp.com">Alison Chaiken</a></b></p>

The films were grown by Bob Bicknell-Tassius.  X-ray diffraction data
were taken by Paul Bacon.  The theta offset for these theta-2theta
spectra was chosen to maximize the InSe peaks, which had the effect of
minimizing the Si (111) peak at 28.442&#176;.  Paul Bacon indicates
that (except as noted) all films are 100 nm InSe/10 nm GaSe/miscut Si
(111).
<p>

Experiments on polycrystalline films (and to a lesser extent, on the
MBE-grown films) indicate that In-rich films have better transport
properties than Se-rich ones.  Taking into consideration peak widths,
XRD therefore indicates that the best films grown in 2003 are
020303-2, 020303-4, 020303-3 and 011603-3, approximately in that
order.  SEM images confirm that 011603-3 has a smooth surface suitable
for laser marking.  None of the recent films has x-ray peaks as narrow
as 042902-3.

<li><a href="0304xrd.jpg">030403</a> x-ray diffraction spectra
compared to 042902-2.  -2 and -4 have well-resolved InSe and GaSe
peaks, just like 042902-2, although -2's InSe peak is broader.  -1
appears quite interdiffused, while -6 and -3 look somewhat
interdiffused.  -5 looks like it has no GaSe.
<p>

<li>X-ray diffraction scans of the <a href="bestold.gif">MBE's
greatest hits</a> films.  042902-3 and 052802-2 show strong peaks for
both InSe and GaSe.  The 092502-1 and 092502-3 films do not show GaSe
peaks but do have a peak for the conducting orthorhombic
In<sub>4</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> phase.  The presence of this phase
indicates an In-rich stoichiometry.  LBNL's photoluminescence data on
042902-3 showed In<sub>4</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> despite the lack of a
distinct peak in XRD.  The highest EBIC gain has been observed in
pieces of 092502-1 that were specially annealed by John Chen.
<p>

The <a href="bestoldrc.gif">rocking curves</a> for these films show
that only 042902-3 has its planes aligned perpendicular to the film
normal.  The 092502-3 and 052802-2 films have their planes aligned
perpendicular to the Si (111) zone axis instead.  It's not clear
what's going on with 092502-1 since the Si axis is nominally set to +4
&#176; in this experiment.  The 042902-2 rocking curve has a FWHM of
0.41&#176;, while 092502-1 has a FWHM of 0.72&#176;.
<p>

<li>X-ray scans from <a href="0114.gif">run 011403</a>.  All six films
contain the gamma-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> phase whose presence
indicates a Se-rich stoichiometry.  The GaSe peak is not observed.
Note the broadness of the InSe peak compared to 042902-3.  A shoulder
on the h-InSe (004) peak may be an indication of a ternary InGaSe
phase.  For some InSe films grown on GaSe single crystals, <a
href="http://web.hpl.hp.com/org/research/ars_media/XRD/mystery.gif">these
peaks were strong and well-resolved.</a> A simple calculation shows
that most of the unidentified peaks match a hypothetical material with
c = 16.47&#197;.  By comparison, h-InSe has c = 16.640&#197; and
h-GaSe has c = 15.907&#197;.  The 042902-3 data have been divided by
10 for ease of comparison.
<p>

Rocking curves for these films have a FWHM of about 1.6&#176;.
<p>

<li>The <a href="0116.gif">run 011603</a> films have various secondary
phases.  Several of the films show distinct GaSe peaks, especially
011603-6.  011603-2, 11603-3 and 011603-4 all show the ternary
shoulder.  011603-4 and 011603-6 both show some
In<sub>4</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> while 011603-2 and 011603-7 show a
In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>.  011603-3 and 011603-5 have a weak peak
in-between the In<sub>4</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> and
In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> peaks that could belong to either (or
neither) phase.  011603-1 appears to be single-phase, but the Si peak
could be obscuring a secondary-phase peak.  The 042902-3 data have
been divided by 10 for ease of comparison.
<p>

Rocking curves FWHMs for these films vary from 1.2&#176; for -6 to
1.6&#176; for -2.
<p>

<li>The <a href="0129.gif">run 012903</a> films have
In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> as a secondary phase, meaning that they
are Se-rich.  It's not clear whether the -7 film's slightly
lower-angle peak is also In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>.  The GaSe peak
here is only a poorly resolved bump.  There is no sign of the ternary
shoulder.  Note how broad the peaks of the 012902 films are compared
to 042902-3, whose data have been reduced by a factor of 10.
<p>

<li>The films of <a href="0203.gif">run 020303</a> differ greatly from
each other.  Unlike the previous 2003 runs, all the films have
well-resolved GaSe peaks.  -2, -3, -4 and -5 all have
In<sub>4</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> peaks, while -6 has two
In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> peaks.  -1 has a peak at 27.2&#176; which
does not match any of the likely phases well.  The width of the XRD
peaks for these films is narrower than for previous 2003 depositions.
Note that the 042902-3 data is not scaled here.
<p>

<a href="0203rc.gif">Rocking curves</a> show that the 020303 films
have their planes aligned more perpendicular to the Si (111) zone axis
than to the substrate normal.  Their appears to be a trend in
alignment versus InSe film thickness, but caution is required since
all wafers may not have the same miscut, or may be rotated slightly
differently.  The 020303-4 has the best rocking curve width, about
0.69&#176; FWHM.
<p>

<li>The <a href="0210.gif">run 0210</a> films appear to be completely
single-phase.  However, the GaSe peak is poorly resolved and the InSe
peaks are rather broad.
<p>

<a href="0210rc.gif">Rocking curve</a> FWHMs are about 1.1&#176;.  The
planes are aligned normal to the Si zone axis rather than to the
surface normal.
