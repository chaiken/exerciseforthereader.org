    Union City, Newark and Milpitas, CA </h1> <hr />

<h2>As of January 2007, I no longer maintain or update this web page.</h2>

    <p>
      I'm tired of hearing people say, "There are no good restaurants
      in Fremont." I think that what they mean is, "I don't like Asian
      food." Poor lost souls, they don't know what they are missing! I
      like spicy food and garlic and detest sugar or mayonnaise in
      entrees. I'm not watching my fat or sodium intake, I'm
      exercising instead. If you have similar tastes and know worthy
      restaurants in this area that are not mentioned here, please do
      <a href= "mailto:alison@exerciseforthereader.org">send
      email</a>.  I'm particularly looking for good <a href=
      "http://www.thingsindian.com/rest.htm">Indian</a> or seafood
      restaurants, pho joints and gourmet ice cream in our area.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chinese Restaurants
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>North China Restaurant</strong>, in the Raley's
      shopping center, near Fremont Super Saver theatre, off Paseo
      Padre between Walnut and Mowry.
      <br />
      This is the only tablecloth restaurant we patronize regularly.
      The folks at North China understand well that "chili oil" and
      gai lan are appropriate ingredients in Chinese food and that
      "honey prawns" and celery are not. (Yes, I have taken some
      Chinese cooking classes, since you ask.) Almost all the entrees
      are good here, everything from the Szechuan whole fish to
      hot-and-sour soup to mu shu. You can get away for $20 for two
      people for dinner with beer even though you will be quite
      full. Two entrees plus soup is way too much for two people to
      finish. Service is reasonably fast, too, and the restaurant is
      open later than most in Fremont, I think until 10PM.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fu Lam Moon</strong>, on Albrae near Costco in Newark
      and near the intersection of Dixon Landing and N. Milpitas
      Ave. in Milpitas.
      <br />
      Fu Lam Moon is  the best local dim sum successor to the
      much-mourned Furama. The Newark location is more crowded than
      the Milpitas one but also has a greater variety of food. We
      haven't tried ordering from the menu yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>China Chili Restaurant</strong>.<br />
      Why is this restaurant so crowded? The food is oversugared
      and full of celery -- yuck. At North China you never have to
      wait for a table.
      </p>
    <p>
      <strong><a href="http://www.mayflowerrest.com/">Mayflower
      Seafood Restaurant</a></strong> in the Milpitas Square
      Shopping Center just south of the intersection of 880 and
      237.
      <br />
      The well-regarded dim sum at this restaurant was tasty
      enough, but it was also considerably more expensive than the
      much-lamented Furama. The parking lot at Milpitas Square is
      an incredible zoo, and the mob at the restaurant is
      impressive. All in all Mayflower is a bit more trouble than
      Fu Lam Moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><a href="http://www.newtungkeenoodle.com/">New Tung Kee
      Noodle House</a></strong> in the Fremont Hub near Jacks.
      <br />
      New Tung Kee is the best bargain of any of the places we
      regularly visit. The restaurant offers a large variety of
      noodle, soup and egg-cake dishes, from pad thai to chow fun to
      pho to vermicelli soup. All are well-prepared, with little sugar
      or cornstarch, and they taste great with the addition of the
      chili oil, vinegar and pickled pepper condiments on every
      table. The egg-cake dishes (flour, daikon and taro varieties)
      taste like hash browns and eggs and are perfect for
      breakfast. Entrees range in price from $3.50 to about $7.00, not
      much more than what it would cost you to prepare these dishes at
      home. Besides the entrees, the restaurant offers pearl tapioca
      drinks and beer. Tea comes free with each meal.  Service is
      rapid and while the decor is spartan, the tables always look
      clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Grand Orient</strong> restaurant, once near Barnes
      and Noble and Starbucks at the intersection of Fremont and
      Mowry. Grand Orient has unfortunately closed. Anyone know
      another good local source of Peking Duck? We've had good luck
      with Peking Duck on Castro in Mountain View.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Final word on Chinese food: Do you think that <a href=
      "http://web.mit.edu/afs/athena.mit.edu/user/w/c/wchuang/www/menus/menus/Mary_Chungs.txt">
      Mary Chung</a> would deliver to California?

    <h2>
      Indian Restaurants
    </h2>
    <p>
      The 2000 census says that fractionally Fremont has the
      largest Indian population of any city in the Bay Area. Surely
      there must be an appealing Indian restaurant in the
      Fremont/Union City/Newark area; I just can't seem to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>New Taste of India</strong> on Warm Springs Boulevard
      near the Milpitas border has a decent lunch buffet on weekends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Copper Chimney</strong> and <strong>Indian
      Palace</strong> seem always to be closed for private parties
      when we stop by. We've tried Indian Palace unsuccessfully 3
      times; I can't figure out how to tell when it is really open.
      Meanwhile, reliable sources indicate that the vegetarian
      <strong>Udupi Palace</strong> and <strong>Woodlands
      Restaurant</strong> in Newark are worth a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of late we have tried three Pakistani halal restaurants,
      <strong>Shahi Kabob</strong> in Union City on Alvarado-Niles
      near Decoto, <strong>Pakwan</strong> in the Irvington section of
      Fremont, and <strong>Shalimar</strong> in the shopping center on
      Walnut near Paseo Padre.  Pakwan and Shalimar have satisfyingly
      spicy curries, but all three restaurants present meat dishes in
      a way that seems odd to Western diners. Rather than offering
      small pieces of meat cooked in a sauce (what I expected), or
      even large pieces of meat that need to be cut up, the curries
      and masala dishes have bones with small adhering pieces of
      meat. The food tastes perfectly fine but picking something
      inedible out of your mouth with every bite gets tiresome.
      Kabobs at Pakwan are truly boneless.  Perhaps the chops offered
      at Shalimar are a better bet.  Pakwan and Shalimar are quite
      noisy inside although Pakwan has a pleasant outdoor seating
      area.  Not surprisingly, none of these restaurant serves
      alcoholic beverages.  Portions and prices at all three are quite
      reasonable.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Japanese Restaurants
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Yuki Restaurant</strong>, on Driscoll Road at Paseo
      Padre, in the same shopping center as Longs Drug. <br /> While
      the menu is short, there are a number of unusual items, like
      mirugai kushiyaki (moist roasted clams on a skewer) and
      "mini-don." Many dishes are smaller, inexpensive portions that
      are readily combined with other a la carte items. Based on half
      a dozen visits, the fish quality is reliable and the prices are
      reasonable. The specials are always creative presentations like
      the burdock, carrot and sesame salad and not some ridiculous
      cream-cheese-and-hot-sauce roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Kioku Restaurant</strong>, in the Lido Supermarket
      shopping center on Newark Boulevard just south of Route 84 in
      Newark.<br />
      We've only been to Kioku half a dozen times and are very
      impressed. Kioku positively stunned me by using real crabmeat
      not only in sashimi, but also in sunomono and in the little
      dish of salad that came before the meal. The other food we
      had was delicious, especially the Hawaiian-style poke roll.
      Mirugai sashimi was pleasingly crunchy and was a large
      serving for the price. Our total for dinner for two with sake
      was about $34, and believe me, you could pay more than that
      for far inferior sushi in scores of restaurants. The
      atmosphere is soothing, as the restaurant is carpeted and has
      piped-in jazz. Major thanks to Neoncap for recommending we
      try this place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ichiban Restaurant</strong>, on the east side of
      Foothill Blvd. in Hayward's downtown area, near the
      intersection of Foothill with A Street.<br />
      For years, this was my favorite Japanese restaurant, but now
      I'm torn. The fish is ultrafresh, the selection is excellent,
      and the presentation is lovely. Ichiban is our favorite
      special occasion restaurant. I prefer the chirashi sushi,
      which is a big bowl of rice with a nice assortment of pickled
      vegetables and fish on top. The bento boxes are also a
      bargain. We have never had any suspect fish here even once
      despite repeated visits. The service is fast, although you
      will have to wait for 15 minutes for a table on a Friday or
      Saturday night. Two people can have a big meal with sake for
      about $20-25.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Koma Restaurant</strong>, in the Fremont Hub Shopping
      Center, on the west side of Fremont Blvd between Walnut and
      Mowry.<br />
      [As of 6/2004, Koma is gone, along with the whole building
      and Helen's Pho, too. We have yet to try the new sushi place,
      Sushi Harbor, next to Bed, Bath and Beyond.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Yuri Restaurant</strong>, near Starbucks and Barnes
      and Noble Bookstore and Noah's Bagels, in a shopping center
      on the south side of Mowry Ave. just east of Fremont Blvd and
      west of Mission.<br />
      Like Komasushi, Yuri suffers in comparison to Ichiban. Unlike
      Koma, Yuri doesn't seem to have quality problems on weekend
      nights. We have never had to wait at this restaurant, and the
      service is always fast and friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sushi Lovers'</strong> in Milpitas we found to be
      indifferent, not as good as Koma or Yuri or Ichiban. We have
      been to <strong>Sei Sho Sushi</strong> in Irvington only once
      since we got some smelly fish there.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Thai Restaurants
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong><a href="http://www.eastbaythai.com/">East Bay
      Thai</a></strong> near the intersection of Thornton and Cedar
      Avenues in Newark, in a shopping center at the southwest
      corner of this intersection.<br />
      The food at this restaurant is quite good, the decor is nice,
      and the service is lightning fast. If you order the daily
      dinner special, you may be served within 10 minutes even if
      the restaurant is crowded. Alas, East Bay Thai is not open
      for lunch on weekends. About $15-20 for two with beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Kinnaree Restaurant</strong> is at the corner of
      Stevenson and Mission Blvd near "Huggy Bear" or whatever that
      day care place is called.<br />
      Kinnaree is the latest venture by the owners of Krung Thai,
      apparently a popular San Jose restaurant. Kinnaree falls
      somewhere between EBT and Banh Thai on the drool-o-meter but
      has improved since its opening in November 2001 or so.
      Portions can be a bit small. Avoid the fish soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Banh Thai</strong> in the Starbucks/BarnesNoble
      shopping center at the intersection of Mowry and
      Fremont.<br />
      This recently opened restaurant has a somewhat more varied
      menu than EBT. The vegetables in the stir-fries are
      deliciously crisp and the noodle dishes are especially tasty.
      Banh Thai seems never to be crowded, so please go there and
      give them your business!
    </p>
    <h2>
      Singaporean Restaurant
    </h2>
    <p>
      As of 6/2004, Raffles has become Pakwan, a halal Pakistani
      restaurant.  The Banana City Cafe in Walnut Plaza in central
      Fremont is not Singaporean but Malaysian.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Korean Restaurants
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Kum Kawn Restaurant</strong>, on the left side of
      Fremont Blvd just southwest of the confusing Five Corners
      intersection in Irvington.<br />
      Gone alas! as of 4/2002, replaced by the also-Korean "House
      of Tofu," which based on one visit, has similar food.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Manna Restaurant</strong>, in Newark in a strip mall on
      the south side of Mowry School Road, across Albrae from
      Chevy's.<br /> We've only visited Manna only once but were
      pleased. The barbecued meats were tasty, the portions were
      generous and the decor was far more attractive than the slightly
      dingy Kum Kawn.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Vietnamese Restaurants
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Helen's Pho</strong>, in the Fremont Hub shopping
      center, on the west side near Argonaut Way and
      <strong>Koma</strong> restaurant.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      [As of 6/2004, Helen's is gone, along with the whole building
      and Koma, too.]  Milpitas has <strong>Huong Lan</strong> and
      <strong>Lee's Sandwiches</strong>; who has a banh mi or pho
      place to recommend in Fremont?
    </p>
    <h2>
      Farmstands
    </h2>

    <p>
      No discussion of eating in the Tri-City area would have been
      complete without a mention of the <strong>Nagata Brothers
      farmstand</strong> at the intersection of Mission and Stevenson
      Boulevards. Alas, Nagata disappeared on Halloween 2003 in a big
      trick on everyone in the neighborhood. Ever since I've been
      visiting the <a
      href="http://www.fremont.gov/Visiting/Attractions/FarmersMarkets.htm">Irvington
      Farmer's Market</a>. The produce choices at the Farmer's Market
      are not much different than 99Ranch and the prices are only fair
      but the freshness is clearly superior to supermarket fruits and
      vegetables.  The atmosphere of the market is intoxicating: the
      milling crowds, the strange patter and the exotic smells
      transport you from suburbia to the Pacific Rim.  The best buys
      I've found so far are <a
      href="http://www.prevedelli.com/">Prevedelli's</a> wonderful
      heirloom variety apples.  Other hard to find items include
      Concord grapes, bouquets of Thai peppers, <a
      href="http://jixing.en.alibaba.com/product/50086957/50463609/Fresh_fruits/Chinese_Winter_Jujube.html">jujubes</a>
      and <a
      href="http://www.foodvancouver.com/silk-road-bolani.jpg">Afghan
      bolani bread</a>.  Usually there's some live music.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="supermarkets">Supermarkets</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Consider <strong><a href= "http://www.99ranch.com/">99
      Ranch</a></strong> (on Fremont Boulevard near Thornton),
      <strong>Marina Seafood</strong> (on Alvarado-Niles at Decoto in
      the El Mercado Center) or <strong>Lion Food Center</strong> (at
      the Warm Springs/Mission intersection). These Asian markets have
      the best selection of fresh fish and the nicest butcher shops in
      the Tri-City area, plus the expected exotic ingredients. At 99
      Ranch I <strong>highly</strong> recommend the "Express Chinese
      Gourmet" pre-made salads, with tempting combinations like
      cuttlefish and gourd strips, or spicy mustard, tofu and peanut,
      or crunchy sweet-and-sour cabbage, daikon, carrot and
      ginger. These salads are so addictive that I suspect that they
      contain human pheromones.  I challenge anyone to find more
      healthful and tasty takeout food. Still, if you want to buy bleu
      cheese, you'll have to go to <a href=
      "http://www.traderjoes.com/locations/map/77.asp">Trader
      Joe's</a> or Safeway.  The local Raley's (Paseo Padre near
      Walnut) has a rather poor produce and butcher selection but does
      carry bulk items like bulgur wheat that are unavailable
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Coffehouses
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <strong><a href=
      "http://www.fremontcoffee.com/mvcrc.htm">Mission Valley Coffee
      Roasting</a></strong> stores feature fresh beans prepared right
      on the premises. MVCR has lighter roasts than S******ks. Besides
      the beans, there are pastries, comfy chairs, patio seating, a
      variety of fancy coffee drinks and a selection of teas. However
      the best reason to patronize MVCR is Gael and Don Stewart's
      support for the arts in our local community. They serve
      refreshments, often for free, at events from Ohlone College to
      Central Park. As of 9/2005, there is only one location, on
      Washington Boulevard near Ellsworth.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Beer
    </h2>
    <p>
      An altogether different topic! For brewpub advice visit <a
      href="http://www.kenpapai.com/beer/pubrank.nocal.html">Ken
      Papai's page</a>. I generally agree with his rankings although I
      would place <a href="http://www.mendobrew.com/">Mendocino
      Brewing</a> and <a
      href="http://www.pacificcoastbrewing.com/">Pacific Coast
      Brewery</a> higher and <a
      href="http://www.avbc.com/main.html">Anderson Valley</a> and
      <strong>Humboldt Brewing</strong> much lower.  Ken's somewhat
      outdated web page doesn't mention the <a
      href="http://www.ukiahbrewingco.com/">Ukiah Brewing Company</a>
      at all, which is too bad since the place has delicious food and
      frequent live music in addition to fine beers.  The <a
      href="http://www.sierranevada.com/">Sierra Nevada Brewpub</a> in
      Chico, on the other hand, is the Central Valley branch of
      Heaven. Fremont Brewing Company has reopened as <strong>Jack's
      Brewpub</strong> in the Fremont Hub, but unfortunately the
      hefeweisen is the only decent beer we've had there. The india
      pale ale and amber ale were nearly undrinkable at Jack's and the
      pub grub is way overpriced.  Consider having a pitcher of
      margaritas at Chevy's in Newark instead. Or travel to
      <strong>Mr. Mike's</strong> on Main Street in Niles and survey
      the Tri-Cities' best selection of bottled beer. <em>Sousa's
      Liquor</em> in the shopping center on Washington Boulevard near
      Paseo Padre has a large if idiosyncratic selection.
    </p>
    <h2>Best places for take-out in the vicinity
    </h2>
    <ul>

    <li><p><em>M&#252;nchner Haus</em> is a deli specializing in
    German items.  A variety of unusual sausages, cold cuts and salads

    <p>Only open until 6 PM, M&#252;nchner Haus is located on the east
    side of Fremont Boulevard just south of Mowry.  It cannot be seen

      Afghan Restaurants

      Since people always ask, I'll explain that we rarely eat at
      Afghan restaurants since I find the food a bit bland.

      Non-Asian Restaurants
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fine Asian cuisine is what we have here in Fremont/Newark;
      there's no point in fighting it. We do also like Fremont's
      <strong><a href= "http://www.habibirestaurant.com/"> Habibi
      Restaurant</a></strong> in the Irvington Five Corners shopping
      center near Safeway and not far from <strong>House of
      Tofu</strong>. Habibi has all your favorite Lebanese dishes
      (dolmas, falafel, shawarma, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh), the
      service is charming, and the owners have a liquor license. The
      prices are quite reasonable and the food is mostly healthy. Hey,
      what's not to like? And last but not least, we like <strong>New
      York Pizza</strong> on Fremont Boulevard near Roberts in the
      Five Corners neighborhood of Irvington. New York Pizza has the
      best basic thin-crust pizza we've had on the West Coast, and
      it's dirt cheap.
