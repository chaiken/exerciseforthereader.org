%        The incomplete-reaction hypothesis  is  interesting in light of the
%two-stage intercalation that produces $\rm C_4KHg$: first, the formation of
%$\rm C_8K$,  and   then   the   cooperative  intercalation  of  K   and  Hg
%vapor.\cite{timp83,lagrange80} If  lower-$\rm T_c$ samples are  the product
%of an  incomplete  reaction,  one  might   expect them  to have   lower  Hg
%stoichiometries.  However, fits to neutron diffraction data do not support
%lower Hg stoichiometry for the gold phase (as discussed below).
