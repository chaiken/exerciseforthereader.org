        This  appendix contains the source code  for  the programs  sf  and
rhocalc.  sf is  a  routine which optimizes structural  parameters for $\rm
C_4KHg$ by fitting  neutron diffraction structure factors.  sf  is based on
Equations~\ref{stfact}  and \ref{hamilton}.  This  program should be easily
adaptable to other structures or to x-ray diffraction data.

        rhocalc   is   a Fourier-transform  program   which   converts  the
reciprocal space  information of  the structure  factors  into a real-space
structure.   Essentially   rhocalc  is   a   software  implementation    of
Equation~\ref{denscalc}.  It should require only  trivial modifications for
use with a different structure.

        Both rhocalc and sf make use of some of the utility subroutines
listed in Appendix~\ref{utility}.
