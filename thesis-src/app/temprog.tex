        This  appendix contains the  source  code for the   program hc2 and
hczero.  hc2  is a routine  which  fits the WHHM  theory to $\rm H_{c2}(T)$
data.  This    code is based  on Equation~\ref{makidegennes}   with various
embellishments to  incorporate effects related  to Pauli paramagnetism  and
spin-orbit  coupling.   The  physics content  of   hc2 comes  from  FORTRAN
routines written by  Eric Tkaczyk and  J.A.X. Alexander, but the algorithms
are  improved,  and the  code has  been   rewritten in  the   C programming
language.

        hczero finds parameters which give a  least-squares linear fit of a
line or quadratic to  $\rm H_{c2}(T)$ data.  Both hc2  and hczero make use
of some of the utility subroutines listed in Appendix~\ref{utility}.
