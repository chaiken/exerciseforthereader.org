\chapter{Utility Programs}
\label{utility}
\pagestyle{headings}

        This appendix  contains source  code  for some  utility subroutines
which are used by the main  programs listed in Appendices~\ref{structprog},
\ref{angprog}, and \ref{temprog}.    These subroutines were written by 
Wolfgang Rupprecht, whose assistance in  writing the  programs in the other
appendices is gratefully acknowledged.

        Also included  here is  the source for   the program chisq,   which
calculates the reduced chi-squared parameter.
