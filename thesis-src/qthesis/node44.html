        The effect of hydrogen on superconductivity in  C<SUB>8</SUB>K must be a
balance  of opposing tendencies  since hydrogen can   either raise or lower
 T<SUB>c</SUB>.  From the discussion above concerning the transition metals, one
might anticipate that the opposing factors might be the decrease in carrier
density and  increase  in  electron-phonon  coupling  that   are  generally
associated with hydrogenation of metals.[<A HREF="node66.html#switendick78">233</A>] The  T<SUB>c</SUB>'s
of hydrogenated K-GIC's are collected in Table <A HREF="node44.html#khtctable"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.

        The situation  in  the KH-GIC's is complicated  by the  presence of
multiple phases, just as in the KHg-GIC's.  In  the KH-GIC's, both <i>alpha</i>
( I<SUB>c</SUB> = 8.43-8.53 &#197;) and <i>beta</i> ( I<SUB>c</SUB> = 9.13  &#197;)  phases can
coexist   in  a  given  sample.[<A HREF="node66.html#I217">213</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#suzuki85b">231</A>]   The structure    and
stoichiometry of these phases is uncertain.[<A HREF="node66.html#miyajima88">171</A>]  To complicate
matters further, staging disorder is also a common feature of the KH-GIC's,
unlike the KHg-GIC's, which are nearly always single-stage.  One reason for
the staging disorder in  the chemisorbed compounds  is the complex behavior
as  a  function of   hydrogen stoichiometry.   Starting  with  a  C<SUB>8</SUB>K
sample, hydrogen goes into interstitial sites in  C<SUB>8</SUB>K up  to x = 0.1.
For x <b>&gt;</b> 0.1, the stage II compound, also denoted  C<SUB>8</SUB>KH<SUB>x</SUB>, begins to
form.  Stage I and stage II coexist until  x = 0.67, when  the last stage I
material  transforms  to  stage  II.[<A HREF="node66.html#lagrange74">153</A>]  Other   reasons  for
disorder are the large number of  steps that  go into  the reaction and the
fairly complicated final structure.
<P>
        Despite  all this complexity,  Enoki  <em> et  al.</em> have  done an
admirable job of making sense out of  the numbers in Table <A HREF="node44.html#khtctable"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
Their  interpretation,  which is based  on specific  heat  and conductivity
measurements, is summarized  by Figure <A HREF="node44.html#khC_v"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> below.    The decline in
<i>Gamma</i> with increasing x shows that H is lowering the carrier density and
must have at   least a partially ionic  character.   The lower density   of
states  in the  KH-GIC's  as  compared  to the   K-GIC's is   also  seen in
Shubnikov-deHaas[<A HREF="node66.html#Z260">79</A>]  and   optical   measurements.[<A HREF="node66.html#doll87">62</A>] The
sequential increase  and decrease in  <i>theta</i><SUB>D</SUB> and   T<SUB>E</SUB> shows that
hydrogen first stiffens and then softens both the  acoustic and optic modes
in  C<SUB>8</SUB>K.

        The data shown in Figure <A HREF="node44.html#khC_v"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> can be analyzed to produce the
numbers    listed   in  Table <A HREF="node44.html#khcvtable"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>,  which   is   adapted   from
Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#enoki85">78</A>].  The  conclusions one draws  from  examination of this
table are similar to those from study of the transition metal hydrides, but
with some important differences.  As noted in Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#enoki85">78</A>], the main
effect of hydrogen is that as a function of x  the electron-phonon coupling
parameter increases and the density of states at the Fermi level decreases.
The  T<SUB>c</SUB>  enhancement with hydrogenation  is  therefore accounted for
mostly  by a   larger <i>Lambda</i>.   The   increase  in  <i>Lambda</i><SUB>ep</SUB> with x   is
overwhelmed at large x by the decrease in carrier density that is reflected
by the fall in the DOS.

        None of the previous statements is  at  all surprising in  light of
the results  of hydrogenation  on the  transition metals.  What is a little
bit hard to account for is the mechanism by which <i>Lambda</i><SUB>ep</SUB> increases.
According   to  Equation <A HREF="node43.html#lambdacalc"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>,  the   hydrogen-induced rise  in
<i>theta</i><SUB>D</SUB>  and  T<SUB>E</SUB> in the  KH-GIC's should  lower rather than  raise
<i>Lambda</i><SUB>ep</SUB>.  The source of the  T<SUB>c</SUB> increase in  the KH-GIC's may
be the  optic  modes associated with  the  hydrogen atoms, just   as in the
hydrogenated   transition metals.[<A HREF="node66.html#enoki88">77</A>]   The  very slight metallic
character of H in KH-GIC's[<A HREF="node66.html#miyajima88">171</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#enoki87">75</A>] could contribute to the
enhancement of the   electron-phonon coupling.  Evidence  for the  hydrogen
hole band near   the  Fermi level comes from   electron   spin   resonance,
thermopower, and conductivity  measurements.[<A HREF="node66.html#miyajima88">171</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#enoki87">75</A>]   The
schematic density of states of  C<SUB>8</SUB>K before and after hydrogenation is
shown  in   Figure <A HREF="node44.html#khdos"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.   The  reasonableness  of   the  optic-mode
explanation for the hydrogen-induced  T<SUB>c</SUB> increase is  hard to judge,
but further experiments are underway.

        Superconductivity in the KH-GIC's is not completely understood, but
there are several generalizations that can be made.  Firstly, hydrogenation
tends   to decrease the   density of states at  the  Fermi level by putting
carriers into low-lying hydrogen bands.   Secondly,  hydrogenation strongly
increases the electron-phonon coupling, although how  exactly it does so is
not clear.  Whether the optic phonons associated  with hydrogen are crucial
for the KH-GIC's, as they are in the transition metals, is not yet certain.
<P>
        Besides the  KH-GIC's,   another group of  materials  with  much in
common  with  the KHg-GIC's is  the transition metal  dichalcogenides.  The
effect of  hydrogenation on superconductivity   in the TMDC's  is discussed
below.
