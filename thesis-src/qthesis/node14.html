<A NAME=synth>&#160;</A>

        The basis for understanding the synthesis of a ternary
graphite intercalation compound comes from an examination of the phase
diagram of the relevant binary alloy.  The phase diagrams of the K-Hg
and Cs-Bi binary alloy systems are shown in Fig. 3.1.  There are two
reasons that the phase diagrams are important.  One is that the phase
diagram gives pertinent information about temperatures and alloy
compositions necessary for preparation of a given GIC, as discussed
below.  For example, when a particular heavy element has only limited
solubility for the alkali metals, as in the case of lead,[<A
HREF="node66.html#hansen58">103</A>] then that heavy metal will be
difficult, if not impossible, to intercalate in combination with an
alloy.  This is the case for lead, as has been shown by various
unsucessful attempts at intercalation, both here at MIT and by
Lagrange and coworkers.[<A HREF="node66.html#lagrange85">146</A>]
Also,since many of the properties of GIC's are similar to those of the
intercalant,[<A HREF="node66.html#I94">67</A>] the phase diagram is a
useful source of information about the GIC.  For example, inelastic
neutron scattering studies of the
C<SUB>8</SUB>K<SUB>1-x</SUB>Rb<SUB>x</SUB> system have shown that the
elastic constants of the intercalant layer are minimum at the same x
where the eutectic point of the binary phase diagram occurs.[<A
HREF="node66.html#neumann84">183</A>] <P>

<BR><STRONG>Figure 3.1:</STRONG> Phase diagrams of the K-Hg and Cs-Bi
binary alloys.[<A HREF="node66.html#hansen58">103</A>]<BR> <P>

According to Lagrange[<A HREF="node66.html#lagrange87">145</A>], the
stage of a GIC is determined only by the stoichiometry of the starting
alloy.  This finding is illustrated by Figure 3.2, which shows that a
given composition range for each of the K-Hg and Cs-Bi systems
corresponds to a unique stage in the final sample.  The current study
confirms the idea that alloy composition is the primary determinant of
stage in the ternary GIC's.  Good agreement was also found between the
composition ranges indicated on the phase diagrams for production of a
given stage and the results reported here.  <P>

        There were three fundamentally different methods used to synthesize
the specimens used   in these studies.  These  are   contact-intercalation,
sequential  vapor-phase     intercalation,   and single-step    vapor-phase
intercalation.  In the  contact-intercalation and  single-step  vapor-phase
intercalation  techniques,  the starting  alloy was   reacted  first in  an
evacuated pyrex tube,  and then exposed  to  the  graphite in   a  separate
furnace session.  An amount of alloy  several times the  quantity needed to
complete   the  reaction  stoichiometrically   was  always   used.   In the
sequential intercalation  method  used  for  C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg,   C<SUB>8</SUB>K was
prepared  by   reaction    of  elemental   potassium    with  graphite   at
200&#176;C, and  then a stoichiometric amount of   mercury  was reacted
with the  C<SUB>8</SUB>K at 290-300&#176;C.   This temperature was chosen to
be just above the liquidus line for the compound   KHg<SUB>2</SUB> (see the K-Hg
phase diagram),   from which   C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg  also  can  be prepared.   The
sequential-intercalation  method  was  first discovered   by El Makrini and
coworkers.[<A HREF="node66.html#elmakrini80a">73</A>]
<P>
        The  principal  difficulty    with the   single-step    vapor-phase
intercalation technique was  the  inaccuracy  of measurement of the  alkali
metal.  The  volume  of  the alkali  metal  was  estimated by measuring the
volume of its glass container, thereby  assuming that the  metal filled the
container uniformly,   without   any cavities.  A   more accurate    way of
measuring the amount of alkali metal (and of  measuring mercury) is to have
a microbalance in  the glovebox where the  metals are handled.   This
technique  was   employed by   the  research group  at   the  University of
Kentucky.[<A HREF="node66.html#doll86">63</A>]
<P>
        Contact intercalation,  in which the  graphite starting material is
actually in  contact with the liquid intercalant  inside an evacuated pyrex
ampoule, was used in the synthesis of  all CsBi-GIC's.   The starting alloy
used  in  these  reactions was   Cs<SUB>5</SUB>Bi<SUB>4</SUB>, and  the temperature of  the
intercalation was  about 480&#176;C to  500&#176;C,  just above the
liquidus line for the alloy  (see the phase diagram).   If the liquid metal
were not  placed in   contact with  the graphite, then   even if  all other
conditions were right, the final product was always  C<SUB>8</SUB>Cs.[<A HREF="node66.html#E291">36</A>]
This reaction was almost foolproof:  every   single  attempt at making  the
CsBi-GIC's  with the   contact   method resulted in   the intercalation  of
single-stage CsBi-GIC.   C<SUB>4</SUB>CsBi<SUB>0.5</SUB> <i>alpha</i>-phase  samples  were
violet, and   C<SUB>4</SUB>CsBi<SUB>1.0</SUB> <i>beta</i>-phase  samples were blue-green, as
previously reported.   Thus  it  appeared that    the CsBi-GIC's are   less
sensitive to the details of preparation than the KHg-GIC's.
<P>
        The difficulty with the contact reaction was that the GIC's
were often embedded in the hard alloy metal when the intercalation
ampoule was removed from the furnace.  Removing the samples from the
alloy without fracturing them was often a tricky business.  An attempt
was made to remove the liquid alloy from the sample surface by tilting
the entire furnace a few hours before the intercalation ampoule was to
be removed, but these attempts were unsuccessful.  The other problem
with the CsBi intercalation, which probably is related to the contact
reaction, is that macroscopic inclusions of the starting alloy were
often found inside the samples. This is discussed further below, and
also in Section 6.2.<P>

        The single-step vapor-phase two-zone technique can be used to
synthesize both C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg and C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg, as originally
reported of El Makrini <em> et al.  </em>[<A
HREF="node66.html#elmakrini80a">73</A>] The modifier ``two-zone'' here
refers to the fact that the graphite may be kept at a slightly higher
temperature (T <SUB>prep</SUB> + <i>Delta</i>T) than the alloy (
T<SUB>prep</SUB>) in order to prevent condensation of metal on the GIC
surface.[<A HREF="node66.html#I94">67</A>] In the C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg
case, KHg<SUB>2</SUB> alloy was placed inside an evacuated ampoule
with graphite and the two were reacted isothermally at
290&#176;-300&#176;C for three weeks.  The KHg<SUB>2</SUB> alloy was
silver in color, and the stage II GIC was always blue, both as
previously reported.[<A HREF="node66.html#J140">248</A>] In the
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg case, the starting alloys ranged in composition from
K<SUB>2</SUB>Hg<SUB>3</SUB> to K<SUB>5</SUB>Hg<SUB>4</SUB>.  The
reaction was carried out at temperatures between 200&#176;C and
260&#176;C for a period of two weeks.  These alloys were gold in
color, and the intercalation compounds ranged in tint from gold to
copper to pink.  No systematic effects were seen as a function of the
starting alloy composition in C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.  Most reactions were
carried out with the alloy KHg.  <P>

        Temperature differences <i>Delta</i>T between the graphite and
the alloy for C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg were varied between 0&#176; and
10&#176;, as opposed to the case for C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg, where only
isothermal conditions were employed.  In the case of isothermal
reactions, the intercalation ampoule was wrapped in several thick
layers of aluminum foil in order to guard against unintended
temperature gradients in the furnace.  If the intercalation ampoule
was kept short, and a large furnace was used, it is estimated that the
temperature at the two ends of the ampoule could be kept the same to
within a degree or two.  Through use of an ice-point reference on the
furnace's temperature controller and liberally applied glass wool
insulation, the temperature of the intercalation ampoule could be
controlled to within about &#177;10&#176;C during the reaction.  <P>

        The outcome of the C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg reaction is quite
sensitive to the temperature of the furnace.  On more than one
occasion, a tube containing KHg alloy plus graphite which had
mysteriously not reacted at all was removed from the furnace.  Half
the time the intercalation could be accomplished simply by cooking the
tube for another couple of weeks, under apparently identical
conditions.  The trickiness of the C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg intercalation has
been noted before by Timp.[<A HREF="node66.html#J140">248</A>] It is
not surprising that the C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg intercalation is more
difficult than that of a compound with a simpler structure, like
C<SUB>8</SUB>K, but it is somewhat unexpected that the
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg preparation is much more difficult to control than
that of C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg.  Samples from two C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg batches
are almost indistiguishable from one another, even if one is made
through sequential intercalation, and the other made using a
single-step vapor-phase reaction.  The predictability of the
C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg reaction is underlined by the reproducibility of its
superconducting transition temperature, as measured by several
research groups.  These T<SUB>c</SUB> values are gathered in Table
3.1.  In contrast, the T<SUB>c</SUB> values reported for
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg and shown in Table 3.2 exhibit
a great deal of scatter.  <P>

T<SUB>c</SUB> values for C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg as reported by several

T<SUB>c</SUB> values for C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg as reported by several
research groups.  There is a great deal of scatter in the values,
which seem to fall primarily into two groups, with most likely values
being about 0.8 and 1.5 K.  <i>dagger</i> indicates a broad
superconducting transition.  <i>ddagger</i> indicates a
liquid-nitrogen quenched sample.[<A
HREF="node66.html#delong82a">58</A>]<BR>

        Why should the results of the stage II intercalation be so
much more reproducible than those of the stage I?  The answer seems to
lie in the multiphase behavior of C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg, as opposed to the
single-phase behavior of C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg.  C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg has only
one common in-plane ordering, the (2&#215;2)R0&#176; in-plane
superlattice which has been observed in neutron diffraction.[<A
HREF="node66.html#kamitakahara84b">124</A>] This ordering is
associated with an I<SUB>c</SUB> = 13.56 &#197;, the only repeat
distance observed in C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.[<A
HREF="node66.html#kamitakahara84b">124</A>] C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg, on the
other hand, has two commonly observed phases.  These are the
<i>alpha</i> phase, which has a (2&#215;2)R0&#176; in-plane ordering
and I<SUB>c</SUB> = 10.24 &#197;, and the <i>beta</i> phase, which has
a (<i>sqrt</i>3&#215;2)R(30&#176;, 0&#176;) in-plane ordering and
I<SUB>c</SUB> = 10.83 &#197;.[<A HREF="node66.html#J140">248</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#kamitakahara84">123</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#K167">246</A>] <P>

        More details about the microstructure of the specimens used
for the superconductivity studies are given below.  The main point to
be taken away from the discussion here is that the synthesis of
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg is very sensitive to the exact conditions used
because different conditions will produce a given combination of
phases, as previously noted by Timp.[<A
HREF="node66.html#J140">248</A>] <P>

        Even after several years of study of the question of the
connection between preparation conditions and the various phases,
there are still many uncertainties.  As an example, notice in Table
3.2 that the T<SUB>c</SUB> = 0.719 K and 0.822 K gold samples were
produced with nominally the same conditions that usually give pink
T<SUB>c</SUB> = 1.5 K GIC's.  Also, the T<SUB>c</SUB> = 1.472 K and
1.317 K specimens came from the same intercalation ampoule.  <P>

        A few general statements about the synthesis of
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg may be made, despite some uncertainties.
Intercalation at temperatures significantly higher than 200&#176;C
produces samples with broad superconducting transitions that are more
or less copper in color.  The intercalation temperature of 350&#176;C
used by Yang <em> et al.</em>[<A HREF="node66.html#yang88">270</A>]
would be expected to result in specimens with quite broad
superconducting transitions.  Intentional use of a temperature
difference (<i>Delta</i>T) on the order of 10&#176;C does consistently
produce gold, low- T<SUB>c</SUB> specimens, as originally noted by
Timp and coworkers.[<A HREF="node66.html#J140">248</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#timp83">249</A>] Kim and coworkers also observed
that use of a temperature difference during intercalation increases
the final amount of the I<SUB>c</SUB> = 10.83 &#197; <i>beta</i>
phase.[<A HREF="node66.html#kim84">130</A>] The recent experiments
seemed to show that temperature differences on the order of 5&#176;C
were sufficient to produce degradation in the superconducting
properties, in contrast to Timp's claim that small temperature
differences enhance superconductivity.[<A
HREF="node66.html#J140">248</A>] <P>

        The snag in this neat explanation is that gold samples were
sometimes produced using an isothermal reaction.  Whether this was due
to poor control of the temperature difference between the alloy and
graphite is not known.  In addition, attempts to produce gold GIC's
with T<SUB>c</SUB> 0.7K sometimes resulted in copper-colored samples
with broad transitions.  It seems likely that other poorly controlled
factors were also playing a role.  <P>

        One possible factor is the overall time allowed for the
reaction.  In the current work, and also that of Timp,[<A
HREF="node66.html#timp83">249</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#J140">248</A>]
the intercalation was allowed to proceed for two weeks or longer,
whereas Iye and collaborators[<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>]
only allowed intercalation to occur for ``several days''.  Yang and
coworkers also allowed only ``several days'' for their reactions.[<A
HREF="node66.html#yang88">270</A>] The Univ.  of Nancy group does not
specifically state how long they allowed for intercalation of their
samples (which were used in the specific heat studies of Alexander
<em> et.  al</em>[<A HREF="node66.html#alexander81">8</A>]). The
reaction time could be an important variable if, for example, the
higher- T<SUB>c</SUB> phase is the equilibrium state of the system,
but its formation is slower than that of the lower- T<SUB>c</SUB>
phase.  If this were the case, leaving the ampoule in the furnace
longer might result in a higher- T<SUB>c</SUB>.  Bendriss-Rerhrhaye of
the University of Nancy notes that in the CsBi-GIC's the pure
<i>beta</i> phase is produced if the reaction is allowed to proceed
for two weeks, but that a mixture of <i>alpha</i> and <i>beta</i> is
found after only one week.[<A HREF="node66.html#bendriss86">17</A>]In
this interpretation, if for some reason a particular batch of graphite
was harder to intercalate, KHg intercalation compounds formed from it
might still be in the gold, lower- T<SUB>c</SUB> phase after the usual
reaction period, even with <i>Delta</i>T = 0.  Alternatively, a
particular intercalation might take longer if the KHg alloy used had
been contaminated by air and had a refractory oxide coating.  <P>

        Another factor in the intercalation of C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg which
has received little attention in the literature is how the
intercalation ampoule was transferred into and out of the furnace.  In
the experiments reported here, the furnace was always cooled down to
about 70&#176;C before the ampoules were removed.  Sometimes, though,
the furnaces were cooled down overnight.  At the University of
Kentucky, it was customary to remove ampoules while they were still
hot.[<A HREF="node66.html#doll86">63</A>] Sometimes the ampoules were
even quenched in liquid nitrogen when they were removed from the
oven.[<A HREF="node66.html#delong82a">58</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#heinz83">107</A>] It is not known what practice the
Japanese,[<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>] French,[<A
HREF="node66.html#elmakrini80a">73</A>] and previous MIT[<A
HREF="node66.html#timp83">249</A>] investigators followed in this
regard.  If the low- T<SUB>c</SUB> phase is the equilibrium phase at
higher temperatures, and the higher- T<SUB>c</SUB> phase is the
equilibrium phase at room temperature, then removing the intercalation
ampoule from the furnace while hot might quench in the
high-temperature, low- T<SUB>c</SUB> phase.  <P>

         Only recently did the MIT investigators become aware of
different practices at different institutions regarding the removal of
the intercalation ampoule from the furnace.  Unfortunately, little
attention was paid to this point during the years of sample synthesis
recorded by Table 3.2.  Recently it was decided to study the effect of
removing the intercalation ampoules from the furnace hot, but the
result was sample exfoliation in each of about 5 batches of
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg thus prepared.  It is not understood why this
exfoliation occurred, since it was not a common consequence of hot
sample extraction at the Univ. of Kentucky.[<A
HREF="node66.html#doll86">63</A>] At any rate, the results of this
study were inconclusive.  <P>

        Annealing studies of C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg seem merited in light of
the possibility that the higher- T<SUB>c</SUB> GIC's are an
equilibrium phase, and the lower- T<SUB>c</SUB> ones are metastable.
Particularly if the intercalation reaction has been hindered by slow
kinetics, it seems that putting a gold low- T<SUB>c</SUB> sample back
into the furnace might improve its superconducting properties.
However, as reported by Lagrange <em> et al.</em>, the thermal
stability of C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg is very low, even in the presence of
excess amalgam, so that attempts at annealing usually result in
deintercalation.[<A HREF="node66.html#lagrange80a">148</A>] The
difficulty of thermally annealling
 C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg is not surprising in light of the exfoliation
problems reported above.  <P>

        A third factor in sample preparation which might well be
thought to influence T<SUB>c</SUB> is the quality of the graphite host
material.  In the stage I binary compound C<SUB>8</SUB>K,
T<SUB>c</SUB> was found to be strongly correlated with the type of
graphite used.  That is, a T<SUB>c</SUB> of 0.15 K appears to be
average for HOPG host material,[<A
HREF="node66.html#koike80">141</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#kobayashi81">136</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#kaneiwa82">125</A>] but T<SUB>c</SUB> = 0.13 is the
highest T<SUB>c</SUB> observed for Grafoil-based samples,[<A
HREF="node66.html#kobayashi79">135</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#kobayashi81a">137</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#sano80">214</A>] and 0.08 K was reported to
C<SUB>8</SUB>K powder.[<A HREF="node66.html#koike80">141</A>] In the
current series of experiments, no such correlation between graphite
type and T<SUB>c</SUB> was found; kish, HOPG, and Madagascar graphite
flakes could all be transformed into gold or pink samples, depending
on the intercalation conditions used.  Defects in the graphite could
be responsible for slight variations in T<SUB>c</SUB> in
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg, say between 1.5 and 1.55 K.  This would imply that
the absolute size of the effect of the graphite host on T<SUB>c</SUB>
(about 50 mK) is constant between C<SUB>8</SUB>K and C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg,
rather than the percentage change in T<SUB>c</SUB> being constant (50
mK is about 30% of T<SUB>c</SUB> for C<SUB>8</SUB>K, but only about 3%
of T<SUB>c</SUB> of C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg).  Certainly the impact of the
starting graphite is not as great for C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg or
C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg as for C<SUB>8</SUB>K.  <P>

        The primary conclusion from the study of the synthesis of
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg is that higher intercalation temperatures tend to
lead to lower T<SUB>c</SUB>'s.  Elevating the graphite temperature
above 200&#176;C seems to suppress T<SUB>c</SUB>, whether the alloy
temperature is also raised or not.  However, raising the temperature
of both the alloy and the graphite tends to give copper-colored
samples with broad superconducting transitions and T<SUB>c</SUB> 1.0
K, while raising only the alloy temperature tends to give gold samples
with narrower transitions and T<SUB>c</SUB> 0.8 K.  These conclusions
are in general agreement with those of Timp and colleagues.[<A
HREF="node66.html#J140">248</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#timp83">249</A>]
However, the synthesis of C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg is still not entirely
understood, since the results of intercalation are not altogether
predictable.  This is believed to be due to the importance of factors
whose importance is difficult to evaluate.  Among the possibilities
are the duration of the intercalation reaction, hot intercalation
ampoule extraction, and alloy cleanliness.  <P>

        Reproducibility problems with the T<SUB>c</SUB> of
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg are undoubtedly due to the several in-plane phases it
can contain.  The wide variation found for C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg contrasts
with the ease of reproducing results for C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg, which has
only one in-plane phase.  One naturally wonders whether the difficulty
of reproducing superconductivity in the CsBi-GIC's is also tied in
with the question of multiple phases.  This question is discussed
further in Section 6.2.  The section that follows, Section 3.3, treats
the normal-state characterization of the GIC's used in the
superconductivity experiments.  The relationship between the in-plane
