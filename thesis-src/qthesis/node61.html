<P>
        One of the recurring themes in the GIC superconductivity literature
has been  the question of whether the  graphite or alkali  metal layers are
superconducting in  C<SUB>8</SUB>K.[<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#takada82">234</A>]   The  origin  of  the
notion  that <em> either </em>  the  graphitic or alkali   electrons must be
responsible for the superconductivity is a bit hard to fathom.   After all,
no one ever discusses the superconductivity of the transition  metal layers
of the transition metal dichalcogenides.  The case  that both graphitic and
intercalant electrons contribute to GIC  superconductivity[<A HREF="node66.html#M143">4</A>] would
seem to be even clearer than the equivalent TMDC question since neither the
alkali metal   nor  the graphite   is separately superconducting.   In  the
MHg-GIC's, the starting alloys are superconducting by themselves.  However,
the   potassium  and mercury planes   cannot be  solely responsible for the
superconductivity of the  compound,   since  otherwise   T<SUB>c</SUB> would  be
expected  to decline monotonically    with increasing stage.  In  fact,  as
discussed in Section <A HREF="node35.html#models"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>,  T<SUB>c</SUB> of  the   KHg-GIC's has  the
opposite trend from that predicted by the proximity effect.
<P>
        Frequent   reference  has   been  made  to  the   properties of the
superconducting transition metal  dichalcogenides in this  work, especially
to  NbSe<SUB>2</SUB>.  In  Chapter <A HREF="node7.html#othersys"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>,   a   progression  in increasing
anisotropy was  proposed that  began with   bulk Nb, followed  by NbSe<SUB>2</SUB>,
alkali-intercalated NbSe<SUB>2</SUB>,  and ended  by  organic-molecule intercalated
TMDC's.   When this  project first began,  there was a natural  tendency to
compare the alkali-intercalated  GIC's with  the alkali-intercalated TMDC's
and  the  acceptor  GIC's   with   the  organic-intercalated GIC's.    This
comparison is a bit misleading, though.  The point that has been overlooked
in this juxataposition is the rather obvious fact that NbSe<SUB>2</SUB>  is already
superconducting.  Because  the properties of the  TMDC's  are  not strongly
modified  by   alkali intercalation,[<A HREF="node66.html#woollam76">266</A>] in  that   case  it is
perhaps appropriate   to speak of   the   superconductivity of the NbSe<SUB>2</SUB>
sandwiches.
<P>
        What is the superconducting sandwich in the case of the GIC's?  The
line  of reasoning     presented   here   suggests   that    perhaps    the
carbon-intercalant-carbon sandwich is superconducting; or perhaps even more
carbon  planes are involved.   If superconductivity is  a joint property of
both carbon and intercalant planes,  perhaps the higher   T<SUB>c</SUB> of   C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg than  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg is not the great  surprise that it  is sometimes
made out to be.  There is no reason that adding more  carbon layers between
the KHg trilayers  should depress  T<SUB>c</SUB> if the  carbon layers are also
superconducting.  Those sceptics  who insist   that  mercury must  dominate
superconductivity in  the KHg-GIC's should  reflect on  the  fact that  the
critical fields of  C<SUB>6</SUB>K[<A HREF="node66.html#avdeev87">13</A>]  are quite similar to those of
 C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.   C<SUB>6</SUB>K also has a  T<SUB>c</SUB> of 1.5 K.[<A HREF="node66.html#avdeev87">13</A>]
<P>
        Iye and Tanuma projected that a 3D-2D crossover might occur for the
stage 3 KHg-GIC, where they estimated that  <i>xi</i><SUB>|| ^c</SUB>   I<SUB>c</SUB>.[<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>]  One can easily see that this estimate should
not   be    appropriate   if  the  carbon  planes    also  participate   in
superconductivity.   If the   carbon   planes that  are    adjacent  to the
intercalant  layers  are also superconducting, then  it is their separation
that  should determine the  coupling  dimensionality.  Presumably at a high
enough stage the superconducting  packages  would be expected to  decouple,
but it  is   not clear what  the  correct  length  scale to  describe  this
decoupling would be.
<P>
        Will  a 3D-2D coupling-dimensionality  crossover  ever  be  seen in
GIC's?  The analogy with the TMDC's helps  to clarify this  question.  When
one  takes  a  superconducting TMDC  and  intercalates it   with an organic
molecule,  the    molecules    act  as   electron  donors.[<A HREF="node66.html#thompson72">243</A>]
Nonetheless,  the organic  molecules  partially  decouple the TMDC  layers,
raise the   resistivity   anisotropy,[<A HREF="node66.html#thompson72">243</A>] and     allow     2D
superconductivity   at low       temperatures.[<A HREF="node66.html#coleman83">46</A>]    Molecular
intercalants into GIC's act as electron acceptors, not donors.[<A HREF="node66.html#I94">67</A>] As
in the TMDCIC's, molecular intercalants in GIC's act  to decouple the layers
and raise the  resistivity  anisotropy.[<A HREF="node66.html#mcrae88">166</A>] The analogy with  the
TMDCIC's leads one to suppose that acceptor should be 2D superconductors at
a sufficiently low temperature.  However, GIC's with molecular intercalants
appear  not to be   superconducting.[<A HREF="node66.html#ericescy">64</A>]
<P>
        The  lack of superconductivity  in  the acceptor GIC's  is not that
surprising if one believes  that the cooperation  of carbon and intercalant
electrons is required.  The intercalant   bands  are  usually the   major
contribution to the c-axis conductivity, so the high resistivity anisotropy
in these materials implies a low carrier density  at the Fermi level in the
intercalant bands.   In fact,  recent work, both experimental[<A HREF="node66.html#mcrae88">166</A>]
and theoretical,[<A HREF="node66.html#E343">229</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#M325">230</A>] suggests   that   hopping  conduction   is
responsible  for c-axis transport  in acceptor GIC's,  at least  for stages
greater than one.  Perhaps band conduction along the c-axis  is a necessary
condition  for superconductivity in  GIC's.   That band conduction is not a
sufficient condition for superconductivity is  shown by the case   of   C<SUB>6</SUB>Li,   which   has   the     lowest resistivity anisotropy     of    any
GIC,[<A HREF="node66.html#mcrae88">166</A>],  and  yet is not superconducting.[<A HREF="node66.html#ericescy">64</A>]  This
problem deserves further investigation.
<P>
        If one believes  following Al-Jishi[<A HREF="node66.html#M143">4</A>] that the presence of
intercalant electrons at  E<SUB>F</SUB> is necessary for superconductivity, then
one possible implication may the  non-existence of 2D superconductivity  in
GIC's.  In other  words,  when one  decouples  the  metallic  planes   with
insulating  intercalants  in the   TMDC's,  one  gets  2D superconductivity
because the  individual  TMDC planes  are themselves   superconducting.  In
contrast,  when one decouples the metallic  carbon  planes  with insulating
intercalants  in the  GIC's,  one   destroys superconductivity along   with
three-dimensionality.    The      Al-Jishi    model     may   imply    that
three-dimensionality is needed for superconductivity in GIC's.  These ideas
lead back to the fundamental question of the nature of superconductivity in
GIC's.
