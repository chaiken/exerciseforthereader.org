        Some progress has been made toward answering most of  the questions
that were asked in the first chapter of this  work.  The one  question that
continues  to  be  elusive   is  the most basic  one,   why is  C<SUB>8</SUB>K
superconducting?   In the coming  years experimentalists could help  to pin
matters down by  extending   the study  of GIC  superconductivity  to  such
compounds  as  C<SUB>8</SUB>K<SUB>(1-x)</SUB>Rb<SUB>x</SUB>  and  C<SUB>6</SUB>Ba since, according  to
available     theories,[<A HREF="node66.html#M143">4</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#takada82">234</A>]   these  compounds    should be
superconducting.    The   C<SUB>8</SUB>K<SUB>(1-x)</SUB>Rb<SUB>x</SUB> system  is   particularly
interesting since several phonon modes  soften dramatically for x  
2/3.[<A HREF="node66.html#neumann84">183</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#solin84a">219</A>] The data in Figure <A HREF="node62.html#softmode"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>  illustrate
the  softening   of  the acoustic    modes   discovered  by  Neumann    and
coworkers.[<A HREF="node66.html#neumann84">183</A>] These authors   attribute   the anomaly    to  a
composition-dependent   charge transfer.   All  other things   begin equal,
conventional theories of  electron-phonon coupling would  tend to predict a
maximum of  T<SUB>c</SUB>  versus x  for the  C<SUB>8</SUB>K<SUB>(1-x)</SUB>Rb<SUB>x</SUB>  system near
this minimum  in the phonon frequencies.  Yet  the  T<SUB>c</SUB>  for x  = 1.0
( C<SUB>8</SUB>Rb) is only 26 mK,[<A HREF="node66.html#kobayashi85">133</A>]  compared to the  T<SUB>c</SUB> =
150 mK for x  = 0.0 ( C<SUB>8</SUB>K).[<A HREF="node66.html#koike80">141</A>]  Investigation of  T<SUB>c</SUB>
as a function of stoichiometry in this system is clearly  an important test
of theories of GIC superconductivity.

system.   The phonons  were  observed using   inelastic neutron scattering.

        The  high-pressure experiments, which show  T<SUB>c</SUB> of  C<SUB>4</SUB>K
to be as high  as  2 K,[<A HREF="node66.html#avdeev86">12</A>]  also offer an  important clue.  The
structure  of   C<SUB>4</SUB>K is currently  uncertain,   but it is  believed to
include   a   double intercalant  layer  of   K    atoms,  much  like   C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.[<A HREF="node66.html#avdeev87">13</A>] These  experiments offer  another fundamental test of
the theories of GIC superconductivity.
<P>
        Despite the  progress reported here in   studies of  the KHg-GIC's,
some   questions about these materials  remain.   In   general, it would be
advisable  to  repeat  many of   the experiments  that have  already   been
performed  (resistivity, susceptibility, specific heat)  on specimens whose
 T<SUB>c</SUB>   has been  measured.    Comparative  studies of   gold  and pink
specimens are  of  particular interest because  of the possibility  of  the
detection of a  charge-density  wave.   More work on  hydrogenation of  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg is  also needed;  studies as a function of  hydrogen uptake are  of
particular interest.
<P>
        In order to interpret these experiments a lot more theoretical work
is  needed, particularly  band-structure   calculations for  input  to  the
microscopic    critical field  models.     As  always   in  the  field   of
superconductivity, experiment and  theory have  a  stimulating partnership.
In  the coming  years   our   understanding of  both low-temperature    and
high-temperature superconductivity will continue to increase.
