        Comparison of critical field experiments on the many types of
anisotropic superconductors shows that these disparate materials look
surprisingly similar.  In particular positive curvature of
H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) and temperature-dependent anisotropy appear to be
common to most of the members of the class.  Somewhat different
features occur in those materials in which the superconducting layers
decouple at low temperatures.  These materials undergo a transition
which is marked by a discontinuity in H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) and a change
from an angular dependence of H<SUB>c2</SUB> from 3D anisotropic
(Eqn. 4.3) to thin-filmlike (Eqn. 4.9).  Except for those of the
TMDC's in which a CDW competes with superconductivity, diluting the
superconducting layers with non-superconducting layers depresses
T<SUB>c</SUB>, in accordance with proximity-effect theories.  As
discussed further later on, the KHg-GIC's do not follow the proximity
effect T<SUB>c</SUB>-dependence, with the T<SUB>c</SUB> even of stage
3 higher than that of the pristine KHg alloy.[<A
HREF="node66.html#J140">248</A>] The findings from the other
anisotropic superconductors suggest that the lack of T<SUB>c</SUB>
depression with increasing stage may be a crucial clue.  <P>

        Most of the findings from previous studies on anisotropic
superconductors can be summarized by examining the progression from Nb
metal to NbSe<SUB>2</SUB> to alkali-intercalated TMDC's to
organic-molecule-intercalated NbSe<SUB>2</SUB>.  Niobium metal in bulk
form is an anisotropic 3D superconductor described by Fermi surface
anisotropy theories.[<A HREF="node66.html#butler80">33</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#kerchner81">129</A>] NbSe<SUB>2</SUB> shows the same
features, only with a greater degree of positive curvature (or
extended linearity) of H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) and larger anisotropy.[<A
HREF="node66.html#dalrymple84">51</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#muto73">181</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#ikebe80">114</A>] The alkali-metal and
alkaline-earth TMDCIC's are even more anisotropic and have even larger
anomalies in H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T).[<A
HREF="node66.html#somoano75">221</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#woollam76">266</A>] The organic TMDCIC's are
2D-coupled superconductors, like Nb thin films, and so are
qualitatively different from the others, which are 3D-coupled.  Yet
the organic TMDCIC's are also clearly the endpoint of a continuum
which has bulk Nb as its other limit.  <P>

        The materials in this chapter also have many features in
common with the superconducting GIC's which are the subject of the
rest of this work.  Many of the theories developed for application to
these other systems will be useful in the study of the superconducting
GIC's, so a familiarity with the previous work is mandatory.  The
similarity between the alkali-metal GIC's and the alkali-metal
TMDCIC's is already apparent, but an attempt will also be made to show
the likeness of the organic-intercalated TMDCIC's and the
non-superconducting acceptor GIC's.  <P>

        The consideration of the properties of the superconducting
GIC's will begin with the preliminaries, sample preparation and
characterization.  <P>
