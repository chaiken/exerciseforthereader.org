<A NAME=ramdata>&#160;</A>

        The motivation for the use of Raman scattering comes from
previous Raman studies of the different phases of C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg by
Timp and coworkers.[<A HREF="node66.html#N128">247</A>] An extensive
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman study by Timp <em> et
al.</em> found zone-folded Raman modes associated with in-plane
ordering.  The identification of Raman peaks with zone-folded modes
can give a clue to the in-plane ordering of GIC's, as explained below.
<P>

        Zone-folded modes are zone-center (q = 0) phonons found in
superlatices.  These modes originate from the folding of the graphite
bands into the zone-center that occurs in superlattice phases that
have a larger real-space lattice constant than graphite, and hence a
smaller Brillouin zone.  Only q=0 modes participate in Raman processes
due to the requirement of wave-vector conservation and the very small
momentum of a photon compared to that of a typical phonon.  In
principle,[<A HREF="node66.html#F120">6</A>] and in practice,[<A
HREF="node66.html#N128">247</A>] the comparison of the positions of
zone-folded Raman peaks with theoretical models allows identification
of the corresponding in-plane superlattice.  <P>

        A Raman study of C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg was performed by Timp <em>
et al.</em> in Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#N128">247</A>].  The essence
of this paper is that the pink samples are identified primarily with a
(2 &#215; 2)R0&#176; in-plane superlattice, while red samples are
identified primarily with a (<i>sqrt</i>3 &#215;
<i>sqrt</i>3)R30&#176; ordering.[<A HREF="node66.html#N128">247</A>]
Figure 1.1 shows the atomic positions corresponding to these in-plane
arrangements.  The gold samples show no evidence of zone-folded peaks
at all.[<A HREF="node66.html#N128">247</A>] Both the pink and red
phases were found to contain as a minority constituent a (<i>sqrt</i>3
&#215; 2)R(30&#176;, 0&#176;).  The observation of the (2 &#215;
2)R0&#176; and (<i>sqrt</i>3 &#215; 2)R(30&#176;, 0&#176;) phases is
in good agreement with neutron diffraction,[<A
HREF="node66.html#kamitakahara84">123</A>] x-ray diffraction,[<A
HREF="node66.html#elmakrini80">70</A>] and TEM[<A
HREF="node66.html#K167">246</A>] experiments.  Kamitakahara[<A
HREF="node66.html#kamitakahara84">123</A>] found using (10<i>l</i>)
neutron diffraction spectra that the (2 &#215; 2)R0&#176; and
(<i>sqrt</i>3 &#215; 2)R(30&#176;, 0&#176;) phases correspond to the
I<SUB>c</SUB> = 10.24 &#197; and I<SUB>c</SUB> = 10.83 &#197; repeat
distances.  The x-ray, neutron, TEM and Raman experiments together
unequivocally identify the 10.24 &#197; <i>alpha</i>-phase with the (2
&#215; 2)R0&#176; in-plane structure, and the 10.83 &#197;
(<i>beta</i>)-phase with the (<i>sqrt</i>3 &#215; 2)R(30&#176;,
0&#176;) in-plane structure.  <P>

        The (<i>sqrt</i>3 &#215; <i>sqrt</i>3)R30&#176; phase has only
been observed in the TEM and Raman[<A HREF="node66.html#K167">246</A>]
experiments, though.  TEM shows that the (<i>sqrt</i>3 &#215;
<i>sqrt</i>3)R30&#176; phase appears to be associated with an
anomalous (9.4 &#177; 0.01) &#197; repeat distance which is not seen
in x-ray or neutron diffraction experiments, even by Timp.  Timp[<A
HREF="node66.html#K167">246</A>] also finds a (<i>sqrt</i>3 &#215;
<i>sqrt</i>3)R30&#176; phase in C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg associated with an
anomalous (12.8 &#177; 0.1) &#197;\ repeat distance.  The usual
lattice constant for C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg is I<SUB>c</SUB> = 13.6
&#197;.[<A HREF="node66.html#kamitakahara84b">124</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#K167">246</A>] Because TEM and Raman scattering are
more surface-sensitive than x-ray and neutron diffraction, the
observation of the (<i>sqrt</i>3 &#215; <i>sqrt</i>3)R30&#176;
structure only in the TEM and Raman experiments suggests that this
phase might be found only near the sample surface.  Although the
evidence for the existence of the (<i>sqrt</i>3 &#215;
<i>sqrt</i>3)R30&#176; phase is compelling, none of this evidence
proves that this structure is found in bulk KHg-GIC's.  <P>

        New Raman spectra were taken by Dr.  G. Doll on pink and gold
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg samples at room temperature.  The GIC's were
HOPG-based and about 3 mm by 3mm by 1 mm in size.  An argon ion
laser's 4880 &#197; line was focussed to a spot on the surface.  Care
was taken to limit the laser power to less than 10 mW to avoid
damaging the samples.  Spectra taken on T<SUB>c</SUB> = 1.53 K and a
T<SUB>c</SUB> = 0.719 K GIC's are shown in Figure <A
HREF="node17.html#ramfig"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif"
SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  The spectra were taken over a
much wider range of frequencies than is indicated in the Figure, but
the only peak observed in either sample is the one displayed.  This
peak corresponds to the E<SUB>2g2</SUB> mode of graphite.[<A
HREF="node66.html#N128">247</A>] The frequency of this peak in the new
work is about 10 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> higher than in the experiments of
Timp and coworkers.[<A HREF="node66.html#N128">247</A>] Raman spectra
were taken on 6 other specimens whose data is not shown, but no
zone-folded peaks were observed.  X-ray diffraction scans taken after
the Raman spectra showed no degradation in staging.  <P>

<P>
        It was  hoped that the  observation of  zone-folded Raman peaks  in
 C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg would allow a systematic study of the relationship
between in-plane structure and superconductivity.  As was shown in
Section 3.4, the c-axis structure seemed to provide no information
about the superconductivity since the (00<i>l</i>) scans of low-
T<SUB>c</SUB> and high- T<SUB>c</SUB> specimens were identical.
Unfortunately the new results on C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg Raman spectra also
show the low- T<SUB>c</SUB> and high- T<SUB>c</SUB> samples to be
identical, in that no zone-folded peaks were seen in any spectrum.
The lack of zone-folded peaks would seem to imply in-plane disorder at
least at the surface in these samples.  Since T<SUB>c</SUB>
measurements were taken on the same samples as the Raman spectra, and
since there was no sample transfer in-between the T<SUB>c</SUB>
measurement and the Raman experiment, one can conclude that the Raman
experiments are much more sensitive to the in-plane order than the
superconductivity is.  The reason may well be that, as mentioned,
Raman is a fairly surface-sensitive probe of ordering, while the
T<SUB>c</SUB> measurements are sensitive to superconductivity anywhere
in a sample's cross-section (see Figure <A
HREF="node26.html#scingfract"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif"
SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>).  Thus any exposure to air
that might have occurred during the sample handling might have
affected only the surface, which would show up in the Raman but not
the superconductivity.  <P>

        Hydrogenated C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg specimens also showed only one
peak in Raman scattering, a Lorentzian E<SUB>2g2</SUB> line at about
1598 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.  The spectra of the hydrogenated samples were
basically indistinguishable from those of the pink and gold samples.
A low-temperature Raman study of these different types of
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg might provide more information.  <P>

        Like the (00<i>l</i>) x-ray data, the Raman data show almost
no difference between the lower- T<SUB>c</SUB> and higher-
T<SUB>c</SUB> C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg specimens.  Therefore they can provide
little insight into the relationship between the in-plane structure
and superconductivity.  In the hopes of answering these questions it
was decided to try neutron diffraction. Since neutrons are quite
sensitive to hydrogen, neutron diffraction data taken before and after
hydrogenation might offer important clues to the puzzle.  <P>
