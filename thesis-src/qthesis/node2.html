        Many people collaborated on the research described in this
thesis.  In particular I would like to thank Jagadeesh Moodera, Eric
Tkaczyk, Paul Tedrow, and Mike Blaho of the Francis Bitter National
Magnet Laboratory for many hours of assistance with the
low-temperature experiments.  Special thanks go to Mike Blaho for
straightening the (ahem) bent <SUP>3</SUP>He refrigerator.  The
high-field experiments could not have been performed without the
assistance of Nai-chang Yeh and Bruce Brandt.  <P>

        The neutron diffraction experiments were performed at the
National Bureau of Standards reactor in collaboration with Dan
Neumann, Bill Kamitakahara, and Ann Bouchard.  The advice of Dan and
Bill regarding the data analysis was invaluable.  Nagel Stone machined
the neutron sample cells, and also provided a lot of useful advice
over the years.  <P>

        Gerhard Roth and Mar&#237;a Kudisch assisted with sample
preparation and x-ray characterization in the early part of the
KHg-GIC study.  Dr.  Toshiaki Enoki of the Tokyo Institute of
Technology participated in the early hydrogenation experiments.  Many
of the ideas concerning the hydrogenation experiments come either from
his advice or his publications.  <P>

      Of the students in the MGM research group, I would especially
like to thank Jim Speck for answering so many elementary materials
science questions about metallurgy and structural analysis.  Thanks
also go to James Nicholls for assistance in performing resistivity
measurements, and Gary Doll and Yachin Liu for taking the Raman data.
Gary greatly improved our methods of GIC synthesis when he arrived, so
all the work on the KHg-GIC's has benefitted from his expertise.  He
also built the hydrogen train which was used in the later stages of
the hydrogenation experiments.  Special thanks go to James, Gary, and
Jim for timely loans of equipment, some of which was even borrowed
with their consent.  <P>

        This thesis could not have been written without Gene
Dresselhaus, Lt. John Steinbeck, Eliot Dresselhaus, and Paul
Dresselhaus, who kept the VAX running most of the time.  Eliot
supplied the text processing and graphics software with which this
document and its figures were produced.  <P>

        Most of all I would like to thank Wolfgang Rupprecht, partly
for tangible favors like explaining electronics, debugging my computer
programs, and making lots of tea.  I would especially like to thank
Wolfgang for encouragement when I most needed it.  <P>

        Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the teachers
who made my experience in graduate school worthwhile.  Frank Payne has
always been very generous with his time, and he puts a lot more effort
than necessary into teaching students about machining.  Terry Orlando
and Paul Tedrow provided a great deal of expert advice about the
theory of superconductivity and data analysis.  Professors
Joannopolous, Jaffe, Tinkham and Jackiw taught courses which were not
only valuable but inspirational.  I also learned a great deal from the
many courses taught by my thesis supervisor, Mildred Dresselhaus.  I
would like to express my gratitude to Millie and to Gene Dresselhaus
for their knowledge, expertise and guidance.  <P>
