<A NAME=neutrons>&#160;</A>

        The original intention of the neutron scattering experiments was to
do a  full structure determination of  the different phases of  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg
through Rietvelt analysis of  a powder diffraction pattern.  Unfortunately,
the  neutron absorption cross-section of mercury  is so high that  taking a
powder pattern turns  out to be impractical.[<A HREF="node66.html#neumann88">184</A>]
<P>
        The next idea was to look at (hk0) in-plane diffraction rings for
the  two  types  of  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg  samples.    It was   anticipated that the
lower- T<SUB>c</SUB> gold samples might show less in-plane  ordering, or perhaps
simply a different intercalant arrangement, and that this arrangement would
change during <em> in  situ </em> hydrogen  exposure.   Because neutrons  are
sensitive to  hydrogen, unlike x-rays  or electrons, this experiment could
even allow the   determination of the hydrogen positions,   should they  be
ordered.  Both  the  <i>alpha</i> and <i>beta</i>  phases  were seen  using neutron
diffraction   by Kim  and   coworkers[<A HREF="node66.html#kim84">130</A>]  and  Kamitakahara    and
coworkers,[<A HREF="node66.html#kamitakahara84b">124</A>]  so the   prospects for success   of  this
experiment seemed quite good.
<P>
        In  order to have  sufficient intensity to see the  desired (hk0)
peaks within a reasonable amount of data collection time, large samples are
required.  Initial attempts    to  synthesize HOPG  samples  of   the  size
(2&#215;2&#215;0.05)   cm<SUP>3</SUP>  were   unsuccessful  because  of  severe
inhomogeneities, much  greater  than those  found in smaller samples.   The
intercalation compounds formed after 4 or 5 weeks in the furnace were black
and still 0.05 cm thick on one end, and obviously gold  (or pink) and quite
thick on the other end.  Despite the fact that these  samples (5 batches of
them) were somewhat  intercalated, they showed  no (00<i>l</i>) x-ray  peaks,
and so were deemed unacceptable  for neutron  diffraction.   Interestingly,
small HOPG pieces and Madagascar graphite flakes in the  same intercalation
ampoule  formed well-ordered  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.   Presumably  the big pieces did
not intercalate uniformly because of small temperature gradients across the
graphite.  In order to prevent thermal gradients from developing, the large
HOPG pieces in the second set of  batches  were packed in glass wool inside
the  intercalation ampoule.   These batches were   left in  the furnace for
about six weeks.  The specimens from the  second set of batches looked more
uniformly intercalated than those from the initial attempts.
<P>
        The samples were mounted in special gas-loading cans
compatible with cryostats of the type designed at the Institut
Laue-Langevin.  These cryostats are similar to normal liquid-helium
ones, such as the Janus Varitemp dewar, except that they have aluminum
``windows'' at the bottom for the admission of neutrons.  The
gas-loading cans were designed by Dr.  D.  Neumann of the National
Bureau of Standards (NBS) to allow the admission of up to ten
atmospheres gauge pressure of gas, more than enough for the
hydrogenation experiment.  (The details of the hydrogenation
experiment are discussed in Chapter 5.)  The samples were affixed with
aluminum foil or vacuum grease inside thin rectangular aluminum
chambers at the bottom of the cans.  The chambers had indium o-ring
seals.  The rest of the gas-loading can consisted of a series of
valves and 1/8&quot; stainless-steel tubing connected to the sample
chamber with standard Cajon VCR fittings.  <P>

        After the GIC's were mounted in the cans,  they were transported to
NBS in Gaithersburg,  Maryland, where  they were   examined  using the BT-4
triple-axis neutron diffractometer.   Thermal  neutrons of wavelength 1.528
&#197; were  monochromated  by   reflection   off an HOPG   polycrystal   and
collimated  with standard neutron  optics.  The diffracted beam was counted
by a <SUP>3</SUP>He detector which was interfaced to a PDP-11 lab computer.
<P>
        Unfortunately on the first trip to NBS, no large
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg samples had been produced which had (00<i>l</i>)
x-rays.  Therefore, small HOPG-based specimens which had been used in
the low-temperature measurements were used instead.  On the second
trip to NBS, there were problems with the reactor, and so no data was
taken due to the lack of neutrons.  By the time neutrons were
available (about 3 weeks), the samples had gone bad, probably due to
slow leaks through the indium seals.  Thus the only data that was
taken was on small (3mm &#215; 3mm &#215; 1 mm) GIC's, which prevented
the observation of (hk0) rings or inelastic phonon peaks.  The neutron
diffraction data consists of (00<i>l</i>) scans on a pink sample, a
gold sample, a gold sample with hydrogen, and a gold sample with
deuterium.  In addition, rocking scans were performed to measure the
mosaic spread of each specimen.  The mosaic spread of these HOPG-based
specimens varied between 1.7&#176; and 2.7&#176;, which are fairly
typical values for GIC's.[<A HREF="node66.html#neumann88">184</A>]
(00<i>l</i>) x-ray and neutron spectra for the unhydrogenated gold
sample are shown in Figure 3.7.  <P>

<P><BR><STRONG>Figure 3.7:</STRONG> X-ray and neutron diffraction
(00<i>l</i>) spectra of a gold C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg specimen.  The
<i>beta</i>-phase peaks are marked with <i>downarrow</i>.  a) Only the
I<SUB>c</SUB> = 10.24 &#197; <i>alpha</i> phase is clearly visible
using x-rays.  The small bump to the left of the (002) may be the
<i>beta</i>-phase (002) peak.  b) With neutrons, both the
I<SUB>c</SUB> = 10.24 &#197; <i>alpha</i> phase and the I<SUB>c</SUB>
= 10.83 &#197; <i>beta</i> phase show well-defined peaks.<BR> <P>

        The neutron diffraction pattern shown in Figure 3.7b) implies
that the <i>beta</i>-phase constitutes about 10% of the specimen.
This is somewhat surprising since the x-ray data in Figure 3.7b) shows
only one set of peaks.  A careful scrutiny of the x-ray spectrum
allows one to identify a candidate for the <i>beta</i>-phase (002)
peak, but nonetheless one would guess from the x-ray data that the
<i>beta</i>-phase is present only in a very small amount.  The
unexpected presence of the <i>beta</i>-phase in this sample invites
the question, Do all gold samples contain some <i>beta</i> phase?  It
seems that x-rays are insufficient to answer this question.  Partly
this is due to the scattering of the x-rays by the
sample-encapsulating tube, but it is also partly due to the limited
skin depth of x-rays.  Timp made a related comment in reference to his
magnetoresistance measurements: ``...the conventional (00<i>l</i>)
x-ray diffraction-characterization technique is an inadequate measure
of the homogeneity of the staging order for SdH measurements, because
the magnetoresistance measurement for homogeneous sytems is sensitive
to the bulk properties of the compound while molybdenum
K<SUB><i>alpha</i></SUB> x-ray radiation has an extinction depth of
only 35 <i>mu</i>m (in stage-1 KHg-GIC's).''[<A
HREF="node66.html#W179">245</A>] The lack of correlation between the
(00<i>l</i>) x-rays and T<SUB>c</SUB> suggests that Timp's comments
about magnetoresistance apply equally well to superconductivity.
Thermal neutrons, on the other hand, have a penetration depth of about
one centimeter, which is more than enough to see the whole thickness
of a GIC.[<A HREF="node66.html#neumann88">184</A>] The idea that all
gold stage I KHg-GIC's contain the <i>beta</i> phase may be important
for understanding the hydrogenation experiments, as discussed in
Chapter 5.  <P>

        An attempt was made to add hydrogen to the gold sample whose
spectrum is shown in Figure 3.7.  Unfortunately the peaks of the
sample could not be found after its transfer from a glass tube to a
gas-loading can.  This transfer was probably unsuccessful because
there was no glovebox available at NBS, and the transfer is too
time-consuming for a glovebag.  Instead of the <em> in situ</em>
hydrogen addition, a gold specimen which had already been exposed to
hydrogen was studied without transfer to a gas-loading can.  The
(00<i>l</i>) data from this sample, whose T<SUB>c</SUB> was 0.84 K
before hydrogenation and 1.54 K afterward, are shown in Figure 3.8a).
The (00<i>l</i>) peaks of an unhydrogenated pink C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg
specimen are presented for comparison in Figure 3.8b).  These spectra
are believed to be the first neutron diffraction scans on
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg which show only the <i>alpha</i> phase; previous
experiments by Yang[<A HREF="node66.html#yang84">272</A>] and Kim[<A
HREF="node66.html#kim84">130</A>] showed both <i>alpha</i> and
<i>beta</i> phase peaks, just as Figure 3.7b) does.  The spectrum of
the deuterated sample is not shown here because these data were marred
by problems with sample motion during the scan, while the other
neutron scans were unaffected by sample movement.  <P>

<P><BR><STRONG>Figure 3.8:</STRONG> Neutron diffraction spectra of a
gold C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg specimen with hydrogen and a pink specimen
without hydrogen.  Note the lack of <i>beta</i> phase in either
sample.  a) Spectrum of a gold sample whose T<SUB>c</SUB> was 0.84 K
before hydrogenation and 1.54 K afterward.  b) Spectrum of a pink
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg sample.<BR> <P> 

        The two spectra shown in Figure 3.8 do not look very different
from one another.  In fact, none of the three neutron diffraction
patterns shown here look very different from one another except for
the presence of the <i>beta</i>-phase peaks in the gold sample without
hydrogen.  In order to be able to intercompare the spectra in a more
quantitative way, the integrated intensities of the diffraction
patterns were fit to a 5-layer model[<A
HREF="node66.html#lagrange83a">151</A>] of the unit cell, using a
gradient-least squares optimization algorithm to obtain the
residual-minimizing parameters.  Only the majority <i>alpha</i>-phase
intensities were fit because the number of peaks in the <i>beta</i>
phase was too small.  <P>

        The method used to fit the integrated intensities is a
standard one, and is similar to that used by Yang and coworkers to fit
their C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg neutron data.[<A
HREF="node66.html#yang84">272</A>] Essentially the method is the
following: the data are converted to relative structure factors
F<SUP>exp</SUP> by dividing the integrated intensities through by the
intensity of the highest peak.  The experimental relative structure
factors are then compared to the calculated ones, which are obtained
from<BR> <P>

<img WIDTH=522 HEIGHT=49 src="patterson.gif">
<P>

where the sum is taken over the 6 layers of the model. Thus the
subscript i stands for the properties of the element in layer i.  A
<SUB>i</SUB> is the neutron scattering factor of the element in layer
i, N <SUB>i</SUB> is its stoichiometry (with respect to carbon = 4), B
<SUB>i</SUB> is its Debye-Waller factor,
<i>theta</i><SUB><i>l</i></SUB> is the diffraction angle,
<i>Lambda</i> is the wavelength of the neutrons, and z <SUB>i</SUB> is
the c-axis position of the ith layer with respect to the center of the
sandwich.  The definitions of the various layer positions are
illustrated in Figure 3.9.  <P>

<BR><STRONG>Figure 3.9:</STRONG> Definition of the
distances z<SUB>i</SUB> used in the fits to the neutron diffraction
data (from Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#yang84">272</A>]).  The
distances are measured from the center of the sandwich, halfway
between the mercury layers.  <i>Delta</i>z, the Hg layer splitting, is
twice the distance of the Hg layers from z = 0.<BR> <P>

        Once the theoretical structure factors were calculated using a
given set of parameters and Eqn. 3.1, the quality of fit was
quantified using a standard expression for the residual parameter
<i>R</i>.[<A HREF="node66.html#hamilton65">101</A>]The definition
of  R used here weights the individual structure factors by
their experimental uncertainties, and is considered superior.[<A
HREF="node66.html#ali88">128</A>] The  <i>R</i> used here is called
the normalized standard deviation and is given by:[<A
HREF="node66.html#hamilton65">101</A>]

<P>
<IMG  WIDTH=509 HEIGHT=81 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="neutronres.gif"><P>
<P>

Here F<SUB><i>l</i></SUB><SUP>exp</SUP> is the observed structure
factor, F<SUB><i>l</i></SUB><SUP>calc</SUP> is the calculated
structure factor, and w<SUB><i>l</i></SUB> is the experimental
uncertainty in F<SUB><i>l</i></SUB><SUP>exp</SUP>.  This experimental
uncertainty comes from instrumental factors and the height of the
background in the spectrum.  The definition of the residual in
Equation 3.2 is different from that used by Yang and coworkers.[<A
HREF="node66.html#yang84">272</A>] Therefore the new residuals
reported here should not be compared with those of Ref. [<A
HREF="node66.html#yang84">272</A>], but should only be used for
intercomparison.  A gradient least-squares routine[<A
HREF="node66.html#bevington69">21</A>] was used to optimize the
parameters by minimizing the magnitude of <i>R</i>.  <P>

        Most of the parameters used to calculate the structure factors
were known beforehand.  The neutron scattering lengths A <SUB>i</SUB>
can be found in any standard nuclear data reference book,[<A
HREF="node66.html#mughabghab73">177</A>] and the Debye-Waller factors
were taken from the work of Yang and coworkers.[<A
HREF="node66.html#yang84">272</A>] These Debye-Waller factors were
B<SUB>C</SUB> = 1.66 &#197;<SUP>2</SUP>, B<SUB>K</SUB> = 0.78
&#197;<SUP>2</SUP>, and B<SUB>Hg</SUB> = 4.75 &#197;<SUP>2</SUP>.
I<SUB>c</SUB> was found from the peak positions in the (00<i>l</i>)
scans, and so was not used as a parameter in fitting the integrated
intensities.  The potassium atoms scatter neutrons so weakly compared
to carbon and mercury that the K positions and stoichiometry have only
a small effect on the fit.  Therefore the K/C relative stoichiometry
was fixed at 0.25.  The remaining parameters were z<SUB>K</SUB>, the
position of the potassium layer, <i>Delta</i>z, the position of the
mercury layer, and N <SUB>Hg</SUB>, the stoichiometry of the mercury
layer.  <P>

        In Table 3.3, the values of these parameters obtained from
fits to the diffraction patterns shown in Figures 3.7 and 3.8 are
compared with the numbers found by Yang <em> et al.</em>[<A
HREF="node66.html#yang84">272</A>] The residual index found for the
fit to the pink sample's data is 0.036, while that found for the gold
sample is 0.044.

<P><img WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=372 src="table3.3.gif"> <BR><STRONG>Table 3.3:</STRONG> Parameters
obtained from fits to the C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg neutron diffraction data.
N<SUB>Hg</SUB> is the number of Hg atoms per 4 carbon atoms.
Additional parameters for the hydrogenated sample: hydrogen position =
3.9 &#197;; hydrogen/carbon ratio = 1.0.  The parameters reported for
the hydrogenated sample are not well constrained since the residual in
this case is considerably higher than for the other diffraction
patterns.<BR> <P>

        For the hydrogenated sample, there were other free parameters
besides those listed in the table.  These were the hydrogen position,
stoichiometry, and Debye-Waller factor.  A ballpark starting value for
the H Debye-Waller factor, 4.58 &#197;<SUP>2</SUP>, was estimated from
the inelastic neutron-scattering data taken on
C<SUB>4</SUB>KH<SUB>x</SUB> by Kamitakahara, Doll, and Eklund,[<A
HREF="node66.html#solin88">218</A>] using a procedure suggested by
Kamitakahara.[<A HREF="node66.html#kamitakahara88">122</A>] (This
procedure is briefly described in Appendix A.)  Unfortunately, even
with all these free parameters, attempts to fit these data with
reasonable numbers produced unacceptably high residual values, on the
order of 0.2.  Here ``reasonable'' is defined very liberally to mean
that the stoichiometries and atomic distances were all required to be
positive.  To obtain even R = 0.2, it was necessary to use a hydrogen
stoichiometry of 1.0 and a hydrogen position of 3.9 &#197;, closer to
the graphite plane than the potassium plane.  Therefore, the values
obtained from the fit to the hydrogen diffraction pattern are included
only for completeness, and are not to be taken too seriously.  <P>

        The failure of the 6-layer  model to fit  the hydrogen data is  not
easily understood.  It does not seem likely that  hydrogen causes a drastic
rearrangement  of the  atomic positions along  the  c-axis considering that
 I<SUB>c</SUB> is unchanged by hydrogenation within experimental error
(see Figure 3.8).  The best course would probably be to fit
(00<i>l</i>) x-rays to determine the positions and stoichiometries of
the non-hydrogen layers.  These other layers' parameters could then be
fixed in fitting the neutron diffraction pattern, where only the
hydrogen parameters would be varied.  The available x-ray
diffractometer cannot provide enough (00<i>l</i>) x-ray peaks to
determine all the K and Hg parameters, though.  <P>

        It was decided to synthesize hydrogenated single-crystal
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg specimens so that their entire (hkl) spectrum could
be imaged in one scan with an x-ray precession camera.[<A
HREF="node66.html#speck88z">222</A>] Then there would be enough peaks
to determine at least the K and Hg stoichiometries, which could then
be used as input to the fits for the hydrogenated samples. In the one
attempt made at a precession camera study of an unhydrogenated
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg single crystal, promising results were obtained.
This work was not completed due to time constraints, but it deserves a
more sustained effort.  <P>

        At this point it is most fruitful to  return to a discussion of the
lessons of   Table <A HREF="node18.html#neutnum"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.    The first  major   point   is the good
agreement between  the   parameters obtained  for the  pink    C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg
specimen and those found by  Yang <em> et al.</em>[<A HREF="node66.html#yang84">272</A>] These samples
appear to have been basically identical.   The gold  sample appears to have
been slightly more mercury-rich than the pink specimen  and Yang's majority
phase.  The parameters for the gold  sample also indicate  that its central
mercury layer was  slightly split, but that  its potassium plane was closer
to the center of the sandwich.  Considering  that the differences among the
parameters of the  various samples are  small,  and that each type of   C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg has been measured only once, any conclusions drawn from the numbers
in this table must be considered quite tentative.
<P>
        In order to get a better feel for  the real-space structure implied
by  the    numbers in   the    table,    the   structure factors    can  be
Fourier-tranformed to yield some information  about  the nuclear positions.
The analytic form of the Fourier transform is

<P>
<img WIDTH=465 HEIGHT=49 src="rhoz.gif">
<P>

where <i>rho</i>(z) is the nuclear scattering intensity as a function
of position along the c-axis.[<A HREF="node66.html#yang84">272</A>] In
order to do this calculation, one must find out the correct signs for
the experimental structure factors from the calculated ones, since the
ratios of the integrated intensities are necessarily positive.  The
density map that results from this construction is called a Patterson
function.[<A HREF="node66.html#speck88z">222</A>] <P>

        Eleven peaks is rather few to perform such a transform since
aliasing will occur on length scales of the order I<SUB>c</SUB>/11 0.9
&#197;.  Therefore, if a good fit to the data has been obtained, a
reasonable procedure is to use calculated structure factors to extend
the experimental structure factors up to higher <i>l</i>.  This
extension was performed up to <i>l</i> = 50 for the pink and gold
samples.  Extending the data of the hydrogenated sample seemed to be a
questionable idea considering the poor quality of the fit.  Patterson
functions were also calculated by the authors of Ref. [<A
HREF="node66.html#yang84">272</A>], so comparison with their
transforms can also be made.  Such comparisons are shown in Figure 3.10.  <P>

<P><BR><STRONG>Figure 3.10:</STRONG> Real-space structure of the
majority phase of C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg along the c-axis as calculated from
the Fourier transform of the extended neutron diffraction data.  All
plots were scaled to a carbon peak height of 1.0.  a) Plot of nuclear
scattering intensity versus distance along the graphite c-axis for a
pink sample (*) and a gold sample (<i>circ</i>).  b) A similar plot
comparing the structure of the MIT pink sample (*) to a structure
(<i>circ</i>) calculated from fit parameters reported by Yang <em> et
al.</em>[<A HREF="node66.html#yang84">272</A>]<BR> <P>

        While the Patterson plots shown in Figure 3.10 do not give any
new information, they do serve to deliver the information in Table 3.3
in more easily digestible form.  There do seem to be small differences
between the pink and gold samples that are larger than the difference
between the pink sample and Yang's parameters for the majority
phase. Since these measurements have only been performed on a few
specimens, it is necessary to be very cautious.  The apparent shift in
the potassium peak position between the pink specimen and Yang's
specimen is meaningless because the potassium layer contributes so
little to the overall scattering intensity.  <P>

        The only distinction between the higher- T<SUB>c</SUB> pink
GIC's and the lower- T<SUB>c</SUB> gold ones that can be made with
confidence is that the gold samples are more likely to contain the
minority <i>beta</i> phase.  This assertion is well-founded because it
corroborates an observation already made with (00<i>l</i>) x-rays.
Because <i>beta</i>-phase peaks were observed with neutrons in a
specimen which appeared single-phase from x-rays, it is tempting to
conclude that all gold lower- T<SUB>c</SUB> C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg samples
contain the <i>beta</i> phase.  The paper of Yang and coauthors
suggests some structural differences between the majority and minority
phases.  The possible consequences for superconductivity of the
slightly higher I<SUB>c</SUB> and Hg content of the <i>beta</i> phase
are discussed in Chapter 5.  <P>

        There are other ways to measure the stoichiometry of compounds
that provide an important check on the parameters obtained from fits
to diffraction data.  Among these are Rutherford backscattering
spectrometry (RBS), weight uptake measurements, and wet chemical
analysis.  The results of these experiments on GIC's are discussed in
the next section.
