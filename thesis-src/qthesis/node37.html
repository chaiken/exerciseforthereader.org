<P>
        One  often hears  the  statement that large  spin-orbit  scattering
increases  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T)  in a   high-field superconductor.   Since  the
spin-orbit interaction   increases  rapidly  as  a  function of  the atomic
number[<A HREF="node66.html#merzbacher70">170</A>] Z,  and since   Hg is a   high-Z element,  it  is
logical to ask whether spin-orbit scattering could enhance   H<SUB>c2</SUB> in
 C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.  The  answer is  no, since  it  turns out that the spin-orbit
``enhancement'' only affects  materials whose critical  fields have already
been depressed    by   Pauli  limiting effects.[<A HREF="node66.html#werthamer66">262</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#orlando79">186</A>]
``Pauli  limiting''  refers to the   upper   bound on  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) from
spin-susceptibility                   (Pauli                 paramagnetism)
effects.[<A HREF="node66.html#clogston62">45</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#chandrasekhar62">38</A>]   Superconductors  close to their
Pauli limit have critical fields which are depressed from the Maki-deGennes
temperature dependence.  Paramagnetic  limiting  also affects  the  angular
dependence  of the    critical field.[<A HREF="node66.html#aoi73">9</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#decroux82">53</A>]  High  rates of
spin-orbit scattering   can   increase   the    susceptibility  of      the
superconducting  state to that  of  the normal state,   and  thus eliminate
Pauli-limiting effects.   Thus  spin-orbit  scattering  and  Pauli limiting
effectively cancel one another out, and the final result of both effects is
the     same       Maki-deGennes     curve        already   discussed    in
Section <A HREF="node34.html#hvstdata"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.[<A HREF="node66.html#orlando79">186</A>]   Since  the two mechanisms cancel,
and since spin-orbit scattering has no major impact for a superconductivity
far   from the   paramagnetic limit,  spin-orbit  scattering  cannot give a
reduced field   h<SUP>*</SUP>(0) <b>&gt;</b>  0.7,  and cannot   explain  the enhanced
linearity of  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) observed in GIC's.
<P>
        While on the subject of electron spin, it is  worth mentioning that
GIC's appear to be far from the paramagnetic limit, as would be expected
for low-critical field materials.  The reason is that orbital
pair-breaking effects are  strong enough in  GIC superconductors that they
are far  from the spin-susceptibility  ceiling on  H<SUB>c2</SUB>.   The small
values  of the  Maki   <i>alpha</i>  parameter[<A HREF="node66.html#maki64">159</A>]   for GIC's clearly
demonstrate the validity  of this  statement, since spin contributions  to the
energy   of  a superconductor   become   important   when <i>alpha</i> >=  1.
WHH[<A HREF="node66.html#werthamer66">262</A>] provided two ways of calculating <i>alpha</i>:
<P>
<P><A NAME=alphadef>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img94.gif"><P>
<P>
 Here <i>Gamma</i> is the linear specific heat coefficient, and <i>rho</i><SUB>n</SUB>
is the  normal-state dc resistivity.  In   Eqn. <A HREF="node37.html#alphadef"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, m is the bare
electron mass, not the effective  mass, since it comes from  e<i>hbar</i>/2 <i>mu</i><SUB>B</SUB>c.[<A HREF="node66.html#decroux82">53</A>] For  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg, the best method  is to use  <i>rho</i><SUB>a</SUB> to calculate <i>alpha</i> for  <i>vec</i>H || ^c, and  <i>sqrt</i><i>rho</i><SUB>a</SUB> <i>rho</i><SUB>c</SUB> to   calculate  <i>alpha</i> for    <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c.   The
parameters    used  were   <i>rho</i><SUB>c</SUB>    =  0.2  milliohm-cm     at  4.2
K,[<A HREF="node66.html#fischer83">85</A>]    and    <i>Gamma</i>   =    0.95   millijoules    /   (mol
K<SUP>2</SUP>)[<A HREF="node66.html#alexander81">8</A>].   <i>rho</i><SUB>a</SUB> at 4.2 K  for  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg (which
has not been reported) was estimated  by assuming a  resistivity anisotropy
of 280,  the  same  as the measured  resistivity anisotropy at  100  K, the
lowest   temperature    at  which    published      <i>rho</i><SUB>a</SUB>     data
exist.[<A HREF="node66.html#elmakrini80">70</A>]  Values  of <i>alpha</i> obtained  from both halves of
Eqn. <A HREF="node37.html#alphadef"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>    are      given       in      Table <A HREF="node37.html#alphatable"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>,
which  demonstrates   that  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg  is  two to  three
orders of  magnitude  away from  Pauli-limiting regime.   With like  assumptions,
similar calculations for other GIC's give <i>alpha</i>'s  of the same  order of
magnitude.  Therefore spin-orbit  scattering has no impact  on the critical
fields of  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.

determination    of   Maki's   <i>alpha</i>  parameter.[<A HREF="node66.html#werthamer66">262</A>]   The
orientation indicated is that of the applied magnetic field. In parentheses
it is noted which of the two halves of Eqn. <A HREF="node37.html#alphadef"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> was used.<BR>
<P>
<P>
        WHH  say  about Eqn. <A HREF="node37.html#alphadef"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>  that  ``It  is a  test of  the
applicability of   our model    for  the   superconductor  that  these  two
determinations  of <i>alpha</i> should agree.''[<A HREF="node66.html#werthamer66">262</A>]   Considering
the crudeness  of  the  assumptions made  in the  estimation of <i>rho</i>, the
agreement in  Table <A HREF="node37.html#alphatable"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>  between   the two  determinations  of
<i>alpha</i>   is quite   good.   This  is an   indication that   even   though
superconductivity   in GIC's has  some  anomalous  aspects, it    still  is
explained by the same basic electron-phonon coupling mechanism that applies
to  isotropic  superconductors.  Therefore, in  our  search  for models  to
explain the enhanced  critical fields of GIC's,  models  with  truly exotic
coupling  schemes  (<em> e.g.,</em> plasmons  and  excitons) can   safely be
ignored.
<P>
         Another factor that contributes  to  critical field enhancement in
isotropic superconductors besides  spin-orbit scattering is strong-coupling
effects.  ``Strong-coupling'' refers to the case of a large electron-phonon
interaction.  The strength of electron-phonon  coupling is measured  by the
size  of the   dimensionless   parameter   <i>Lambda</i><SUB>ep</SUB>,    the   same
electron-phonon parameter that appears   in  the dressed  density-of-states
found from   specific-heat measurements.[<A HREF="node66.html#ashcroft76">10</A>]  Note   that  <i>Lambda</i><SUB>ep</SUB> is not  related   to the magnetic-field   penetration   depth
<i>Lambda</i> (see  Section <A HREF="node28.html#angdata"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> for  a  discussion of the penetration
depth).    McMillan[<A HREF="node66.html#mcmillan68">165</A>] calculated     T<SUB>c</SUB>  in  terms  of
 <i>Lambda</i><SUB>ep</SUB>  and    <i>mu</i> <SUP>*</SUP>,  the   Coulomb  pseudopotential  of  Morel  and
Anderson[<A HREF="node66.html#morel62">174</A>].  He found:<BR>

<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img96.gif"><P>

 where  <i>theta</i><SUB>D</SUB> is the Debye temperature.   Using a typical
number of  <i>mu</i><SUP>*</SUP> = 0.1,[<A HREF="node66.html#mcmillan68">165</A>],  one can solve for
<i>Lambda</i><SUB>ep</SUB>:

 The results of this calculation for the superconducting GIC's

Table <A HREF="node37.html#lambdatable"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  <i>Lambda</i><SUB>ep</SUB>  in  GIC superconductors appears  to be
 0.4,     about   the    same   as   in  prototypical weak-coupling
superconductors like aluminum and zinc.[<A HREF="node66.html#mcmillan68">165</A>] This is in keeping
with one's expectations for a material with a rather low  T<SUB>c</SUB> of about
1-2 K.

<P>
        In  amorphous superconductors, strong-coupling  effects   can cause
extended linearity at   low temperatures.[<A HREF="node66.html#bergmann74">19</A>] However,   the
values  of   <i>Lambda</i><SUB>ep</SUB> quoted  above  eliminate    the possibility that GIC
superconductors are subject  to  any critical field field  enhancement from
strong-coupling effects, since   these   effects are   important  only  for
<i>Lambda</i><SUB>ep</SUB> >= 1.  Furthermore,
since    the strong-coupling  enhancement   is  larger   near     T<SUB>c</SUB>  than  at  low
t,[<A HREF="node66.html#decroux82">53</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#dalrymple83">50</A>] strong-coupling effects tend  to actually <em> decrease</em>
 h<SUP>*</SUP>(0), the reduced field at zero temperature.
<P>
        Recently  some theories of  ultra-strong coupling superconductivity
have been published,  inspired by the  advent of high-temperature
superconductivity.[<A HREF="node66.html#bulaevskii87">31</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#marsiglio87">162</A>] Some of these models find
positive     curvature  of     H<SUB>c2</SUB>(t).    Bulaevskii      and
Dolgov[<A HREF="node66.html#bulaevskii87">31</A>]      find        that        h<SUP>*</SUP>(0)     =
0.45<i>sqrt</i><i>Lambda</i><SUB>ep</SUB> for <i>Lambda</i><SUB>ep</SUB> >> 1.  Marsiglio and Carbotte
find    h<SUP>*</SUP>(0)  about 1.6, but  only   when   T<SUB>c</SUB>   <i>theta</i><SUB>D</SUB>.[<A HREF="node66.html#marsiglio87">162</A>] These   models are  clearly not applicable  to
superconductivity in known GIC's.
<P>
        For  GIC's, a more relevant  consideration  than strong-coupling is
inhomogeneity.     From     both  structural[<A HREF="node66.html#kamitakahara84">123</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#K167">246</A>]  and
superconducting[<A HREF="node66.html#Z234">206</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#delong83">55</A>] studies, there is abundant  evidence for
the coexistence of  multiple phases   in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.  This  evidence  is
discussed  in detail in Chapter <A HREF="node40.html#hydrog"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.    As far  as  critical field
experiments  go, this  multiphase behavior  is important  because  of   the
possibility  that inhomogeneity is the  cause of the  enhanced linearity of
the critical  fields of  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.  Carter  and coauthors[<A HREF="node66.html#carter81">34</A>]
developed a model for  the case of multiphase materials  which contain both
an  equilibrium  and   higher  free-energy phase.    The model  treats  the
inhomogeneity by allowing  the   superconductor  to have a distribution  of
diffusivities described by a function P(D).  Then, instead of the
Maki-deGennes equation (Eqn. <A HREF="node34.html#makidegennes"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>) for the critical fields of
dirty superconductors, one uses:
<P>
<P><A NAME=carter>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img99.gif"><P>
<P>
 where all the symbols are the same as before, and <i>psi</i> is the
digamma function.  Carter  <em> et  al.</em>  found    that by widening   the
distribution P(D) from  a <i>Delta</i>-function  (implied by the   choice of  a
single D value)   to a broad  hump that  they could produce  both  positive
curvature and  h<SUP>*</SUP>(0)   0.85.  By skewing  the distribution P(D)
to  low D, they  could even get   h<SUP>*</SUP>(0)  <b>&gt;</b> 0.9.[<A HREF="node66.html#carter81">34</A>] The
results of their calculations are   shown in Fig. <A HREF="node37.html#inhomo"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, where   h<SUP>*</SUP> (called h in the axis label) is plotted versus  t as a function of the
normalized diffusivity  distribution function,  Q(y).  Q(y) ==  D <SUB>ave</SUB>  P(D), where  D<SUB>ave</SUB> is  the mean diffusivity, and y ==
D/ D<SUB>ave</SUB>.

skewed  to lower  diffusivities  produces  an even greater  critical  field
enhancement at low temperatures.  The index n refers to the power of the
linear factor used to skew the symmetric distribution.<BR>
<P>
<P>
        The  physical cause of  the inhomogeneity-related enhancement has to
do with the  temperature  dependence   of  <i>xi</i>, which  is the approximate
radius of a normal  vortex in  a  superconductor.[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham80">252</A>] At  T   T<SUB>c</SUB>, <i>xi</i> is large, so that vortices must extend over both high-D
and low-D   regions  in the  material.  At  low t,   where <i>xi</i>  has grown
considerably smaller, the  material can  save some  condensation energy  by
preferentially    packing  the vortices into  the   low-D  regions with higher
critical fields.  As  a result, when  <i>xi</i>(T)  becomes on the order of the
domain size,  H<SUB>c2</SUB> will turn upward.[<A HREF="node66.html#carter81">34</A>]
<P>
         Does this   model offer an explanation   of positive curvature and
enhanced   linearity in  the  critical   fields   of  GIC's?   Clearly  the
inhomogeneity interpretation has some appealing  features for  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg,
but it also has some problems.  One is that  among the GIC superconductors,
multiphase  behavior   has been  observed  only in    C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.   As  is
discussed in  Chapter <A HREF="node40.html#hydrog"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>,   C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg is  remarkable  among the
superconducting GIC's for the wide range of  T<SUB>c</SUB>'s  it  exhibits (from
0.7 to  1.6 K), and because it   undergoes  what is  apparently an ordering
transition     under     the    influence     of     small    perturbations
(hydrogenation[<A HREF="node66.html#Z234">206</A>] and  small  hydrostatic pressure[<A HREF="node66.html#delong83">55</A>]).
These features are  not observed  for other  GIC's, which have well-defined
transition      temperatures   and  show   no     unusual   behavior  under
pressure.[<A HREF="node66.html#iye83">116</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#delong83">55</A>] It does not seem to make  sense to attribute
the anomalies in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg to a different cause than the deviations seen
in other GIC's, especially  considering that the other  GIC's  show  larger
anomalies (see Fig. <A HREF="node34.html#rbhct"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>).
<P>
        Even if one were willing to assume separate causes for the enhanced
critical fields  of the  various GIC's, it is not  clear that the  model of
Carter and colleagues would be applicable.  The problem is that their model
makes the (reasonable)  assumption   that   microscopically   inhomogeneous
superconductors  will be   in  the dirty  limit,  where  the  Maki-deGennes
equation is   applicable.   However,   C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg  appears  to  be fairly
``clean,'' at  least for in-plane transport.  The  standard way to quantify
cleanliness in   a  superconductor  is  to calculate   the  parameter   <i>Lambda</i><SUB>tr</SUB> ==   0.882 <i>xi</i><SUB>0</SUB> / <i>l</i>.[<A HREF="node66.html#helfand66">108</A>]  Here  <i>xi</i><SUB>0</SUB> == 0.18 <i>hbar</i> v<SUB>F</SUB>/ k<SUB>B</SUB> T<SUB>c</SUB>  is the Pippard  coherence length, and
<i>l</i> is  the mean-free path.  For  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg, <i>xi</i><SUB>0</SUB> is roughly  9000
&#197;, and  <i>l</i><SUB>a</SUB>, the in-plane  mean-free path, is about 9100 &#197;.  (These  numbers
were  obtained   from   Shubnikov-deHaas  data[<A HREF="node66.html#W179">245</A>]   using  standard
rigid-band analysis,  as demonstrated  in Appendix <A HREF="node65.html#lambda_tr"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.)  Since
 <i>l</i><SUB>a</SUB>     <i>xi</i><SUB>0</SUB>,   the    dimensionless  parameter   <i>Lambda</i><SUB>tr</SUB> == 0.88 <i>xi</i><SUB>0</SUB>/<i>l</i>    0.86 for in-plane transport.    <i>Lambda</i><SUB>tr</SUB> <b>&lt;</b> 1 is
indicative  of fairly   clean  behavior,[<A HREF="node66.html#helfand66">108</A>]   so this  is   an
indication that inhomogeneities are not likely to be the cause  of enhanced
linearity, at least for  <i>vec</i>H || ^c.    However,    this calculation   does   not  rule   out   a
diffusivity-variation influence on  <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c.  Transport
is expected to be much dirtier along  ^c,  where the resistivity
is about 300 times higher than in-plane.[<A HREF="node66.html#fischer83">85</A>]  <i>Lambda</i><SUB>tr</SUB> is estimated very roughly to be about 50 for c-axis transport
by assuming a spherical band.  (No well-bounded  number  is available since
the   Shubnikov-deHaas  data   give no information   about  the intercalant
bands.[<A HREF="node66.html#W179">245</A>]  c-axis transport   in    GIC's     is  discussed      in
Section <A HREF="node58.html#csbidisc"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.)
<P>
        In summary, use   of   the inhomogeneity  model  for enhanced   H<SUB>c2</SUB> can be justified for  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg  for  <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c,
but it is hard to justify for  <i>vec</i>H || ^c, or for other
superconducting GIC's.   Therefore   the most sensible   conclusion is that,
while the factors  discussed by Carter <em> et al.</em> may play a  role  in
 C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg, they  probably  do  not   have a   dominant effect  on   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T).
<P>
        Finally, to round out the discussion  of critical field enhancement
in isotropic superconductors, mention should be made  of the anomalous  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) behavior found in heavy-fermion  superconductors.[<A HREF="node66.html#delong87">57</A>]
These  unusual materials  exhibit both   positive curvature and  large
values of  h<SUP>*</SUP>(0).  Any explanation  of  these phenomena must  remain
tentative  since   the  basic   physics    of these compounds   is    still
controversial,[<A HREF="node66.html#lee86">156</A>]  but  recently  an  interesting   model has been
proposed by  DeLong <em> et al.</em>[<A HREF="node66.html#delong87">57</A>] The  explanation is based
on the observation  that dH<SUB>c2</SUB>/dT <i>propto</i> <i>rho</i>  in the  usual WHH
model, as shown in Eqn. <A HREF="node37.html#alphadef"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>. If  the normal-state resistance  <i>rho</i>  is  assumed
independent of field up to  H<SUB>c2</SUB>, then one gets the usual WHH result
 h<SUP>*</SUP>(0)   0.7.  However,   if  there   is a  very  strong
magnetoresistance    (the   manifestation   of  a  field-dependent  pairing
interaction), then the slope formula shows that  h<SUP>*</SUP>(0) can exceed 0.7
by a factor of  <i>Delta</i> <i>rho</i>(H<SUB>c2</SUB>) / <i>rho</i>.[<A HREF="node66.html#delong87">57</A>] Here <i>Delta</i> <i>rho</i>(H<SUB>c2</SUB>) / <i>rho</i> is
the magnetoresistance  at  the   field  H<SUB>c2</SUB>;  the    normal  state
resistivity at  zero-field  is   extrapolated from above   T<SUB>c</SUB>.   This
formalism  may have wide applicability   to superconductors with  large  or
anomalous magnetoresistance; however, it appears  unlikely to help  much in
the case  of GIC's, since the critical  fields  are  small  enough that the
magnitude of  <i>Delta</i> <i>rho</i>(H<SUB>c2</SUB>)/<i>rho</i> is anticipated to be   0.  The magnetoresistance
of the KHg-GIC's was  observed by Timp  and coworkers, who reported nothing
extraordinary.[<A HREF="node66.html#W179">245</A>]
<P>
        Four    causes  of    critical  field   enhancement    in isotropic
superconductors have been discussed: spin-orbit scattering, strong-coupling
effects, inhomogeneities,  and magnetoresistance.    Of  these, only  the
multiphase-superconductor model of  Carter <em> et al.</em>  is thought to be
relevant to  GIC superconductors.  Inhomogeneity  effects could play a role
for  <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c,  but except for  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg,  there is no
hard evidence for multiphase behavior in other superconducting GIC's except
for  C<SUB>4</SUB>KH<SUB>x</SUB>.[<A HREF="node66.html#Z260">79</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#suzuki85c">232</A>]
<P>
        The extremely anisotropic  nature  of superconductivity  in   GIC's
(1/<i>epsilon</i>  as  high as 47[<A HREF="node66.html#iye83">116</A>])  provides motivation to consider
models   of   positive  curvature  and    enhanced  linearity which   treat
orientation-dependent effects as central.  Some of these models are
considered in the next section.
