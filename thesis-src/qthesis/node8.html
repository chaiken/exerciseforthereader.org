        Anisotropy effects are fundamental to superconductivity.  This
is true because any non-cubic material that can be grown with
sufficient structural perfection should show some anisotropy in its
superconductivity.  Even cubic materials can show deviation from
isotropic models of superconductivity if they have non-spherical Fermi
surfaces.[<A HREF="node66.html#butler80">33</A>] Thus, as pointed out
by Dalrymple,[<A HREF="node66.html#dalrymple83">50</A>] just about all
crystalline superconductors are in principle expected to show some
anisotropy effects.  Clearly these effects are more important in some
materials than in others, and the materials at the high-anisotropy end
of the continuum are more interesting for comparison with GIC's.  <P>

        At the weakly anisotropic end of the continuum are bulk
transition metals like Nb, V, and Tc.  These materials are
three-dimensional anisotropic superconductors characterized by
different superconducting coherence lengths in different
crystallographic directions.  The Pippard coherence length
<i>xi</i><SUB>0</SUB>, is defined to be the approximate spatial extent
of the Cooper pairs.  From an uncertainty-principle-type argument by
Pippard,[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham80">252</A>] this extent must be
approximately <i>hbar</i>/<i>Delta</i>p = <i>hbar</i> v<SUB>F</SUB> /
k<SUB>B</SUB> T<SUB>c</SUB>.  This relationship shows the connection
between the Fermi surface and superconductivity.  <P>

        In the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity (discussed
further in Sections 4.1 and 4.5) a more generalized coherence length
<i>xi</i> is defined.  This Ginzburg-Landau coherence length is
related to the upper critical field for a bulk type II superconductor
by

<P>

where &#248;<SUB>0</SUB> is the superconducting flux quantum.[<A
HREF="node66.html#tinkham80">252</A>] An angle-dependent coherence
length therefore gives an anisotropic critical field.  When a
superconductor has uniaxial symmetry, two of its three pricipal
coherence lengths are the same.  (In the most general case, all three
coherence lengths may be different.)  Then the angular dependence of
H<SUB>c2</SUB> is given by the simple expression:[<A
HREF="node66.html#kats69">127</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#morris72">175</A>]

<P>
<P><A NAME=ldtheor>&#160;</A><IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=45 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=""

where <i>epsilon</i> is the critical field anisotropy parameter of
Morris, Coleman and Bhandari,[<A HREF="node66.html#morris72">175</A>],
defined by:

<BR> <P> <P>
<img WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=26 src="epsdef.gif">
<P> <P>

Except for this angular dependence of H<SUB>c2</SUB>, these weakly
anisotropic superconductors behave for the most part like isotropic
type II superconductors.  For example, the temperature dependence of
their critical fields is given by the usual
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg-Maki theory.[<A
HREF="node66.html#degennes66">54</A>] This theory gives a linear
temperature dependence near T<SUB>c</SUB> and saturation at lower
temperatures.  Linear behavior of H<SUB>c2</SUB> implies because of
Eqn. 1 that <i>xi</i> goes as (1 - t)<SUP>-1/2</SUP>.  <P>

Besides bulk anisotropic superconductors like some of the transition
metals, there is another familiar class of materials with anisotropic
superconducting properties.  This is the class of superconducting thin
films, which were the first anisotropic superconductors to be
studied.[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham63">250</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#burger65">32</A>] When the thickness of a film is
less than the coherence length, the Cooper pairs can only interact
with their neighbors in the plane of the film.  In this case, the film
is commonly referred to as a two-dimensional superconductor because
the Cooper pairs only interact in two directions.  <P>

        As might be expected, the lowering of the effective
dimensionality of a superconductor from three to two dimensions has
important and measurable consequences.  These consequences stem from
the fact that the length scale for superconductivity in the direction
perpendicular to the film is now the film thickness rather than the
coherence length.  Most of the expressions that describe thin-film
superconductors can be derived simply by replacing one of the
coherence lengths in Eqn. 1 by the film thickness, plus some numerical
factors.  For example, consider the critical fields of a thin film.
When the external field is applied along the perpendicular to the
film, Eqn. 1 still holds.  However, for a field applied in the plane
of the film, the critical field for a thin film is now H<SUB>c2, _|_
^c</SUB> = <i>sqrt</i>3&#248;<SUB>0</SUB> / <i>pi</i> <i>xi</i> d,
where d is the film thickness.[<A
HREF="node66.html#tinkham80">252</A>] From the
 (1 - t)<SUP>-1/2</SUP> temperature dependence of <i>xi</i> given
above, one can immediately see that H<SUB>c2, _|_ c</SUB> will have a
square-root temperature dependence: H<SUB>c2</SUB> proportional to (1
- t)<SUP>1/2</SUP>.[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham63">250</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#harper68">104</A>] <P>

        The square-root temperature dependence is one of the hallmarks
of two-dimensional superconductivity.  The other is an angular
dependence of the critical field given by Tinkham's formula:[<A
HREF="node66.html#tinkham63">250</A>]

<p>
<img WIDTH=489 HEIGHT=51 src="tinkham.gif">
<p>

where H<SUB>c2</SUB>(0&#176;) = H<SUB>c2, || c</SUB> and
H<SUB>c2</SUB>(90&#176;) = H<SUB>c2, _|_ c</SUB>.  The angle
<i>theta</i> is defined in Figure 4.6.

        The square-root temperature dependence and Tinkham's formula
for the angular dependence have been observed many times in thin
films.  What is more surprising is that these two-dimensional
properties have also been observed in bulk superconductors which have
a layered structure.  Rigorous calculations for a multilayer structure
composed of superconducting and insulating planes have been performed
by Klemm, Luther and Beasley.[<A HREF="node66.html#klemm75">131</A>]
The KLB calculations show that a dimensionality crossover is expected
to occur at a finite temperature when the parameter <b>r</b> is less
than 1.7,[<A HREF="node66.html#klemm75">131</A>] where <b>r</b> is
defined by <P> 

<img WIDTH=379 HEIGHT=50 src="rparam.gif">

<p>The temperature at which the decoupling of the superconducting planes
occurs occurs is called T<SUP>*</SUP>.  T<SUP>*</SUP> is approximately
defined by <i>xi</i><SUB>|| c</SUB>(T<SUP>*</SUP>) = d.  Usually
layered superconductors show 3D anistropic superconductivity like the
bulk transition metals, but sometimes they show 2D superconductivity
like thin films, and sometimes they even show entirely new effects.
Below, the portion of the work on the upper critical fields of layered
superconductors which is most relevant to the GIC experiments is
briefly reviewed.
