	When a full set of critical field data was desired on a sample, its
zero-field transition was first  obtained to make sure  that the particular
specimen was  in fact superconducting.  Then the  sample  was cooled to the
lowest obtainable temperature, usually about 0.44 K,  at which a  series of
field sweeps was performed as  a function of the  angle between the  sample
c-axis  and the applied field.  The   definition of this angle, hereinafter
called <i>theta</i>, is  illustrated in Figure <A HREF="node27.html#hc2def"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>a.  The samples were
mounted with  their a-axis  vertical, and   the  field of   the  magnet was
parallel to  the ground, so  that the rotation  was accomplished by turning
the probe by hand about its vertical axis.  The relative amount of rotation
was determined by fixing  a pointer to   the  probe and noting its  angular
displacement  with   respect to  a metal  compass  bolted  onto  the <SUP>4</SUP>He
cryostat.  Orientation readings made  in  this fashion were thought   to be
reproducible to about &#177; 1&#176;, an estimate  based on the scatter in
the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) curves.  The exact  direction corresponding to the
samples' c-axis could not be determined <em> a priori</em>  and so was found by
a fit to the angular dependence after the data were entered into a computer
at  a later date.  The  approximate orientation of  the _|_ ^c and
|| ^c   directions  was   estimated  at runtime   by  visual
inspection of the data, and this information  was used  for the measurement
of the temperature dependence of  H<SUB>c2</SUB> at constant orientation.
<P>
	After   a  complete angular   dependence of   H<SUB>c2</SUB> had been
measured at the lowest obtainable temperature, the sample was rotated until
the  applied  field was aligned  parallel to the carbon  (graphene) planes.
This  alignment was not  perfect for several reasons.   The first reason is
the inaccuracy in the <i>theta</i> reading. Secondly, the specimens' a-axis may
not have been exactly vertical due to small inaccuracy in  sample mounting.
The  misalignment  angle between  the   carbon  (graphene)  planes  and the
vertical will be called &#248; to  distinguish it  from <i>theta</i>, the angle
in a horizontal plane between the graphite c-axis and the  applied magnetic
field.  (The angle &#248; is defined pictorially in Figure <A HREF="node29.html#misalign"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.)
Misalignment due to this cause is estimated to be at  most 5&#176;, and
probably  less.  A third  cause of  imperfect alignment  is that the carbon
(graphene) planes of the  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg specimens used  in these measurements
are  not exactly   flat due to   imperfect alignment of  the c-axis  of the
graphite host.  The amount  of misalignment of  the  c-axis  is called  the
mosaic spread.  Also, a small amount  of exfoliation (non-uniform spreading
of  the  graphite layers) tends  to  occur  during intercalation.   Rocking
curves     taken   using     elastic  neutron   (00<i>l</i>)     scans   (see
Chapter <A HREF="node12.html#samprep"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>) showed the mosaic spread  of a few  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg HOPG
samples to  be 2&#176; to 3&#176;.   Some  of the HOPG-based  GIC's
likely  had larger mosaic  spreads.  Mosaic  spreads   as  large as  8 or 9
degrees are not uncommon after  intercalation in ternary and metal-chloride
compounds.[<A HREF="node66.html#speck88"></A>]  The  flattest samples from  a   given  batch were
always chosen for the  critical field measurements, but nonetheless effects
due to   sample  warping  could   not   be  completely eliminated.  Overall
inaccuracy  due to all  these causes  could  perhaps have been as   much as
7&#176;,  and is   estimated  to have  averaged  about  3&#176;  in
practice.  Because these alignment and flatness problems tend to reduce the
observed value of  H<SUB>c2_|_^c</SUB>, the anisotropy values quoted in
this work should be thought of as representing lower bounds.
<P>
	With the applied field parallel to  the carbon (graphene)  planes, a series of
field  sweeps  at  increasing  temperatures   was taken  to  determine  H<SUB>c2_|_^c</SUB>(T).  The temperature was stabilized during these sweeps
by   rapid adjustment of  the various  valves in  the  pumping system.  The
temperature range in which the sample could  be stabilized  during the time
necessary to complete the field sweep was about &#177; 3%, according to the
thermometer.  Of course, the GIC's temperature varied more  slowly than the
thermometer's  due  to its  insulation from  the bath  by its encapsulation
tube.
<P>
	When the temperature series with   <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c  was
completed,  a   similar series with   <i>vec</i>H || ^c was
similarly performed.  These   measurements were  much  less  sensitive   to
misalignment, but were susceptible  (because of the   smaller size of   H<SUB>c2|| ^c</SUB>) to electrical noise that  generated stray fields.
When the  two  temperature series were  finished, two   more  sets  of  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) at constant temperature data could be collected: one at 1.2
K,  which  corresponds to  the lowest obtainable temperature  of the <SUP>4</SUP>He
bath with a roughing pump; and  one set at  0.9 K, which corresponds to the
lowest <SUP>4</SUP>He temperature  obtainable by using a booster  pump in addition.
Reliable  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) data  sets could  not be  obtained  at other
temperatures  because  of the impossibility  of stabilizing the temperature
for  the necessary period of  time  (2 to 3   hours) without an  electronic
feedback system.
<P>
	When  a  full set of   data had  been   obtained,  it was  analyzed
graphically.   H<SUB>c2</SUB> was defined as the  intersection of a line drawn
tangent to the transition with  the level upper  portion of the  sweep, the
same definition as was used in Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>].  The  application of this
criterion for  H<SUB>c2</SUB>  is illustrated in  Figure <A HREF="node27.html#hc2def"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>b.  Other
definitions of   H<SUB>c2</SUB> were tried in  analyzing the  data; while they
slightly changed the results quantitatively, they had no effect on the <em>
shape</em> of any of the curves described here.  (See Figure <A HREF="node29.html#ninetytangent"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>
for  a demonstration of  this.)  The  possibility of bias introduced in the
data analysis is discussed  further in  Section <A HREF="node29.html#extrinsic"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  The  data
were then typed in  by  hand  to a  VAX 11/750  computer   and  fit by  the
appropriate formulae.
<P>
	Electrical    noise   was  not a problem   in   the  critical field
determination since   the signal-to-noise  ratio for the  field  sweeps was
about   1000.   However, the width  and  shape  of the transitions  changed
drastically as the angle <i>theta</i>  was  varied.  This  lack of constancy in
the  shape  of  the transition made   a consistent definition of  the upper
critical field a tricky matter.  The different shapes of the transition are
illustrated  in Figure <A HREF="node27.html#transwidth"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.    The change in  breadth  of  the
superconducting transition with angle  is common to polycrystalline layered
superconductors[<A HREF="node66.html#prober80">200</A>],  and   is due    to the   contribution   of
misaligned grains as <i>theta</i> is varied.  Misaligned  grains have almost no
effect on the field  sweep when  <i>vec</i>H  is applied parallel to  the
c-axis, but will contribute noticeably when  <i>vec</i>H is applied in the
layer planes, perpendicular  to the c-axis.   The reason for  this behavior
comes from the form of  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>), which  is strongly peaked near
 <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c.  In essence, near the  || ^c orientation, since  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) is  fairly  flat, 
slightly misoriented grains have almost the same critical field as the bulk
of the sample.     On  the  other hand,  near   the   _|_ ^c
orientation, where    H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) is  strongly  angle-dependent,
slightly misoriented grains have much lower critical fields  than the bulk,
and  thus contribute to the  foot of the transition, making  it appear much
broader than it would in a perfect crystal.
<P>
        To some extent, the greater breadth of the  <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c transition may be an intrinsic effect.  The reason is that the
anisotropy of  H<SUB>c1</SUB> in a superconductor described by the anisotropic
Ginzburg-Landau theory is  expected to be  approximately the reciprocal  of
the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>  anisotropy.[<A HREF="node66.html#lawrence71">155</A>]  That is, theoretically  H<SUB>c1</SUB> should be lower in the  direction where  H<SUB>c2</SUB> is higher, so
that the transition should be  broader in  the high- H<SUB>c2</SUB> direction.
It is not clear whether the  H<SUB>c1</SUB> anisotropy is also contributing to
the orientation dependence of the transition width.

	There  are   several ways in  which  the critical field experiments
described  in this  chapter    could  have  been  improved.   Firstly,    a
servo-controlled gearing  system for  rotating   the sample  would probably
reduce   the errors  in  the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)  measurements, and would
certainly make these measurements easier to perform.  Probes were available
that have gearing systems for rotating the sample around a horizontal axis,
but not for rotating the sample about a  vertical axis, as was necessary in
this experiment.  Secondly, an electronic temperature controller would have
made it possible to obtain  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)  scans at much more closely
spaced intervals below  T<SUB>c</SUB>, and thus would have  allowed taking many
points in an anisotropy  versus temperature curve.  Thirdly, performing the
data collection with a computer rather than a chart recorder  would greatly
reduce the labor involved in reducing  the data, and also would  allow more
sophisticated real-time  data analysis.  Lastly,  if  a more powerful x-ray
apparatus were  available for doing  diffraction on samples in glass tubes,
it would be possible to measure the mosaic spread of the crystals directly.
This measurement would eliminate some of the  uncertainty in the fitting of
 H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) described  in  the next  section.   All in all, it is
expected that  improvement of the  instrumentation would have a real impact
on  the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T)   experiment,  but  would not   affect   the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) data  much because  of  the limitations due to  crystalline
quality and misalignment.
