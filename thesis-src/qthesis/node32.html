	Another peculiarity of the  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)   curves
is that they  are well-fit  by Tinkham's   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) formula  for
thin films:[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham63">250</A>]<BR>

 The Tinkham formula fit is decent (<i>cal</i> R = 0.83 at t = 0.29
for a  T<SUB>c</SUB> = 1.54 K sample) even without allowing for type I behavior,
and is quite  good  (<i>cal</i> R  = 0.26)   if type I  behavior  is taken into
account.  A summary of the  residuals for fits  to the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) data   is   given in Table <A HREF="node32.html#residsum"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>,  and   a  direct
comparison    between  the     two    types   of  fits    is    shown    in
Figure <A HREF="node32.html#TINKvsAGL"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>a).  Figure <A HREF="node32.html#TINKvsAGL"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>b) shows the errors of the
two fits as a function of the angle <i>theta</i>.  For the  T<SUB>c</SUB> = 1.5  K
GIC's the Tinkham  formula fits have  residuals about  half of those of the
best  AGL       fits.     Consultation    of      standard     tables    on
statistics[<A HREF="node66.html#bevington69">21</A>]  shows that  (for  39 degrees of freedom and a
3-parameter fit, the conditions of  Figure <A HREF="node32.html#TINKvsAGL"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>) there is  about
an 80% probability that the Tinkham formula is a better description of the
data than the AGL model.  The data on the lower- T<SUB>c</SUB> samples are still
best fit by the plain two-parameter AGL theory, just as was reported by Iye
and Tanuma.[<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>]
<P>
	The reason that a  good  fit to Eqn. <A HREF="node32.html#tinkham"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> is unexpected is
that its derivation requires the assumption  that the superconducting order
parameter doesn't vary along the direction perpendicular  to the specimen's
surface.[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham63">250</A>] This assumption  seems reasonable for a film which
has a thickness  less than a superconducting  coherence length, but is hard
to believe when the sample is 10<SUP>5</SUP> coherence  lengths in thickness.  Only
if  the sample   were so disordered  along  the c-axis that its  structural
coherence length was on the order of  the  superconducting coherence length
could   one envision that the   Tinkham formula should  apply.   However, the
metallic  nature  of   the  c-axis  conductivity[<A HREF="node66.html#fischer83">85</A>]   and  the
reproducibility  of the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)  results from  one  sample to
another argue strongly against this interpretation.
<P>
	Tinkham's formula has been used to  fit  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) curves
in  the artificially   structured   superlattice superconductors, such   as
Nb/Cu[<A HREF="node66.html#chun84">42</A>] and Nb/Ta[<A HREF="node66.html#broussard88">29</A>].   However  in these systems
Eqn. <A HREF="node32.html#tinkham"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>  fits   only   below the   3D-2D   crossover  point (see
Chapter <A HREF="node7.html#othersys"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>),  and   C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg  is  clearly well  into  the 3D
regime,  where Eqn. <A HREF="node28.html#ldtheor"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>  is   supposed to  be applicable.  The 3D
nature of superconductivity in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg  is unquestionable  because the
Klemm-Luther-Beasley <b>r</b>-parameter  is about  2000  at  0 K,  while 1  is the
critical   value    for the  dimensionality  crossover.[<A HREF="node66.html#klemm75">131</A>]  (The
question of dimensionality  crossover as  it relates to GIC's  is discussed
further in Sections <A HREF="node34.html#hvstdata"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> and <A HREF="node7.html#othersys"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.)

	Despite the  statistically  significant improvement that  Tinkham's
formula gives over the AGL Eqn. <A HREF="node28.html#ldtheor"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, it is  quite hard to justify
the use  of Tinkham's  formula  theoretically.   One obvious possibility is
that  the  superconductivity  measured  in   C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg   is  not  a bulk
phenomenon, but is merely due to a thin layer on the surface.  The idea is not
that  there is  surface-nucleated superconductivity   at  the   edge of   a
homogeneous  bulk superconductor, but     that  there could  be   a  second
crystallographic phase   stable only near the   surface.  This explanation is
appealing  because it would help explain  the  mystery as to the difference
between the gold and pink phases of  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg : the gold lower- T<SUB>c</SUB>
phase which is   well-fit  by   Eqn. <A HREF="node28.html#ldtheor"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>  would be   due to  bulk
superconductivity, whereas the pink higher- T<SUB>c</SUB> phase would be present
only on  the surface.  A surface phase  present only in  a thin layer could
easily mimic  two-dimensional  behavior, and would    be   expected to  fit
Tinkham's formula.
<P>
	 Superconductivity  in  a surface layer  has  already been shown to
give good  agreement with Tinkham's  formula.  In   lead  films doped  with
thallium, the ``thin film'' was a surface-nucleated layer about a coherence
length thick.[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham64">251</A>]  Nonetheless the ``film'' had critical fields
which agreed quite  well with the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) shape predicted  by
Eqn. <A HREF="node32.html#tinkham"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.   Surface  superconductivity cannot be  responsible for
the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) behavior  here   since it  can   give  only the
anisotropy ratio 1.69 =  H<SUB>c3</SUB>/ H<SUB>c2</SUB>.[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham64">251</A>]
<P>
	There is one major problem with the  idea of the  pink ( T<SUB>c</SUB> =
1.5 K) phase of  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg being present  only as a  surface film.  That
problem is that if thin films are responsible for the angular dependence of
 H<SUB>c2</SUB>, they should give[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham80">252</A>]<BR>
<P>
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img70.gif"><P>
<P>
 where d is the thickness of the film.  As discussed in
Section <A HREF="node8.html#otherintro"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, thin films have  a parallel critical field with a
temperature dependence of the form  H<SUB>c2, _|_ ^c</SUB> <i>propto</i> (1 - t)<SUP>1/2</SUP>, a form which is in definite conflict  with the linear
behavior  found   for  H<SUB>c2, _|_ ^c</SUB>(t).  (The  temperature
dependence of  H<SUB>c2</SUB> at constant angle is discussed  in detail in the
Section <A HREF="node34.html#hvstdata"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.)
<P>
        For a given  anisotropy, the  primary difference  between Tinkham's
formula and  Eqn. <A HREF="node28.html#ldtheor"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> is that  the  Tinkham's  formula curve  has
upward positive    curvature  for  all  angles,   whereas  the  AGL angular
dependence has an   inflection point in  the  wings of the  peak,  and  has
negative curvature at <i>theta</i> = 90&#176;.  The challenge in justifying
the application of Tinkham's formula to GIC's is to think  of a factor that
could  cause  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) to  rise  more  steeply   than  the  AGL
dependence.  One aspect of the problem that is completely overlooked in the
derivation   of  Eqn. <A HREF="node28.html#ldtheor"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>  (and   in the derivation  of Tinkham's
formula, for  that matter)  is the  microscopic physics  of   the flux-line
lattice (FLL).  In an isotropic superconductor, in the absence  of defects,
the axis of symmetry of a vortex must lie along the applied  field.  If the
symmetry axis of the vortex were not along the applied field, the screening
currents  in the vortex would have  to be larger, which  would cost kinetic
energy.  Tilley,[<A HREF="node66.html#tilley65">244</A>] one of  the  originators of the AGL  model,
calculated the  properties of  the flux-line lattice   (FLL) in anisotropic
superconductors.  He found that the energy  of  the FLL is  lowest when the
applied field is  along a crystallographic  symmetry  direction.   When the
applied field is  at an   arbitrary  angle  <i>theta</i>   with respect to  the
symmetry axes,   the vortices  pay  a potential   energy  price  for  their
misorientation with respect to the crystalline axes.[<A HREF="node66.html#tilley65">244</A>] Perhaps
when the applied  field is oriented only slightly  off  a  crystallographic
symmetry direction (such as  <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c), the flux-line  lattice  might actually  minimize its total
energy (kinetic energy  from  screening currents  plus potential energy  of
misorientation)   by orienting the   vortices'  symmetry  axes   along  the
crystallographic symmetry  direction rather than along the   applied field.
Quantitative    calculations by    Kogan[<A HREF="node66.html#kogan81">138</A>]    and   Kogan   and
Clem[<A HREF="node66.html#kogan81a">139</A>] suggest that this rotation of the flux-line lattice may
be a common feature  of anisotropic superconductors.   It is  proposed that
rotation of the FLL to the crystallographic symmetry direction for <i>theta</i>
near  90&#176; could help explain  why the experimental data  rise more
sharply than the AGL model in the wings  of the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) peak.
Unfortunately,  coming  up with  a   test of this hypothesis is   not easy.
Magnetic     torque    measurements  might   be    able    to   give   some
information.[<A HREF="node66.html#hagen87">100</A>]  Kogan  and Clem suggest neutron  scattering and
nuclear magnetic resonance tests.[<A HREF="node66.html#kogan81a">139</A>]
<P>
	In summary,  Tinkham's formula provides  the best  fit to  the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) data for the   T<SUB>c</SUB> =  1.5  K  specimens.  However, the
assumptions used in the  derivation of  the Tinkham formula[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham63">250</A>]
imply  a  temperature dependence of    H<SUB>c2</SUB>    which is strongly  in
conflict    with   experimental  data.     Therefore, solving    the    H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) problems of  the  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg  data  with Tinkham's formula
creates new problems for   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(t).   Figure <A HREF="node32.html#TINKvsAGL"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>b) shows
that the Tinkham's formula fit seems to be an improvement on the AGL theory
principally   in  the    wings,  where the    angular   dependence  of  the
demagnetization may play a role.  Therefore an unsatisfying  but reasonable
conclusion  is that the  agreement  with  Tinkham's formula is  fortuitous,
implying  that the formula  somehow mimics  the combination of  anisotropy,
tilt, type I behavior, demagnetization effects and  mosaic spread that were
actually    present  in the experiments.    Alternatively,  the microscopic
details of   the  flux-line  lattice  may  be   having an  effect  on   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>).
