<P>
        The  primary focus  of  this   thesis    has been to     understand
superconductivity  in  the KHg-GIC's.  There  are  several  aspects to  the
problem.   One is  to understand  the  stage-dependence of  T<SUB>c</SUB>.   As
discussed  in Section <A HREF="node35.html#models"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> and  <A HREF="node61.html#concl"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, the  increase  of  T<SUB>c</SUB> with increasing stage can be  viewed as evidence  of an important role
for graphitic electrons in  GIC superconductivity.   If graphitic electrons
also participate in  superconductivity,  then the apparent increase of  T<SUB>c</SUB> with increasing stage in the KHg-GIC's is not so surprising.
<P>
        The most unusual aspect of GIC superconductivity is the anisotropy
 of  the upper critical field,  H<SUB>c2</SUB>.  This anisotropy  can
also be understood in terms of participation by graphitic electrons in the
superconducting state.[<A HREF="node66.html#M143">4</A>]   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>, T)  data for  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg have been interpreted in terms of the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau
model (AGL).[<A HREF="node66.html#kats69">127</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#morris72">175</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#tilley65">244</A>]  Quantitative agreement was
found for gold specimens with  T<SUB>c</SUB> about 0.8 K, in accord with the
reports of Iye and Tanuma.[<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>]
<P>
        For pink specimens with  T<SUB>c</SUB> about  1.5 K,  corrections to the
AGL model had to be included in order to achieve a good fit.  The  AGL  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) formula agreed  well with the pink   C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg  data once
allowance was made for type I  superconductivity.  Type I superconductivity
occurs in a small temperature-dependent range of applied-field orientations
near   <i>vec</i>H || ^c.  The    occurrence   of  type   I
superconductivity in pink  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg is in accord with calculations based
on the specific heat data of Alexander <em> et al.</em>[<A HREF="node66.html#alexander81">8</A>] The
values of  the thermodynamic critical field  H<SUB>c</SUB> obtained from fits
to the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) data imply a smaller density of states  at  E<SUB>F</SUB>,   N(0),  than that   measured  by Alexander.[<A HREF="node66.html#alexander81">8</A>]   This
discrepancy   concerning the magnitude   of  N(0) could  simply  be  due to
demagnetization  effects on the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)   measurements,  which
could reduce the apparent value of  H<SUB>c</SUB>.  On the other  hand, if the
magnitude of N(0)  obtained from  the  angular dependence  data is correct,
this smaller  value could help to explain  why  T<SUB>c</SUB>  is lower  in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg than in  C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg.
<P>
        Extended linearity of   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) was  also  observed in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.  The temperature dependence   of  H<SUB>c2</SUB>  in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg (and  in other
superconducting GIC's[<A HREF="node66.html#koike80">141</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>]) is reminiscent of critical field
data   on  the layered   TMDC's.[<A HREF="node66.html#ikebe80">114</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#dalrymple84">51</A>]  Because  of the
evidence that both intercalant  and graphitic electrons participate  in GIC
superconductivity, multiband  models of   H<SUB>c2</SUB>  would  appear  to be
appropriate.[<A HREF="node66.html#aljishi88">5</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#entel76">80</A>]  The nearly cylindrical   shape of the
graphitic piece   of   a  GIC's   Fermi   surface[<A HREF="node66.html#I94">67</A>]  suggests  that
anisotropic Fermi-surface models might also  be good candidates to describe
 H<SUB>c2</SUB>    of superconducting   GIC's.[<A HREF="node66.html#butler80">33</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#youngner80">274</A>] More
quantitative information about the Fermi surface of the GIC's is necessary
before    these models can   be  tested,   although   some calculations are
available.[<A HREF="node66.html#holzwarth88">112</A>]
<P>
        Pink and gold  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg specimens were found  to differ in their
superconducting transition  temperature   and critical field   behavior, as
mentioned   above.  The  only   detectable distinction in the  normal-state
properties of these compounds is that the gold specimens often (and perhaps
always)  contain some of   the higher- I<SUB>c</SUB>   <i>beta</i> phase.  The pink
samples, on the other  hand, are  composed solely  of the  lower- I<SUB>c</SUB>
<i>alpha</i> phase.  The relative amounts of the two phases  can be controlled,
within limits, by fine-tuning the intercalation conditions.
<P>
        The  depression of  T<SUB>c</SUB> by  a small fraction  of  the minority
<i>beta</i> phase is  unusual.  In  general, only magnetic   impurities are  so
potent in lowering  T<SUB>c</SUB>.[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham80">252</A>]  Surprisingly,  adding a  small
amount of hydrogen or applying a minute hydrostatic pressure[<A HREF="node66.html#delong83">55</A>]
restores    T<SUB>c</SUB>  to   about  1.5 K.   A    T<SUB>c</SUB> enhancement  by
hydrogenation   and  applied  pressure is   also  seen   in several of  the
transition    metal  dichalcogenides.[<A HREF="node66.html#friend79">90</A>]  These  TMDC's support
charge-density waves,[<A HREF="node66.html#wilson75">265</A>] so the increase  of  T<SUB>c</SUB> with the
application of a small perturbation is attributed to the suppression of the
CDW state.[<A HREF="node66.html#friend79">90</A>] The suppression of  a CDW by hydrogen and applied
pressure also    seems reasonable  in    C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.[<A HREF="node66.html#delong83">55</A>]   The
similarity of the Fermi surfaces  of  the TMDC's and  superconducting GIC's
lends additional credence to the CDW hypothesis.[<A HREF="node66.html#inoshita77">115</A>]
<P>
        The highly variable range of   T<SUB>c</SUB> in   C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg is matched
by the CsBi-GIC's.  For  C<SUB>4</SUB>CsBi<SUB>0.5</SUB>,  T<SUB>c</SUB> has been reported to
be   as        high    as     4      K,[<A HREF="node66.html#mcrae85">168</A>]        while    other
investigators[<A HREF="node66.html#E291">36</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#stang88">223</A>] have found no superconductivity down to 50
mK.  Extensive efforts to reproduce the higher  T<SUB>c</SUB> value have been
unsuccessful.[<A HREF="node66.html#lagrange85a">144</A>]
<P>
        The  apparent  lack  of  superconductivity in  the   CsBi-GIC's  is
puzzling considering that  the alloy CsBi<SUB>2</SUB> is  superconducting with  T<SUB>c</SUB>   =  4.75  K.[<A HREF="node66.html#mcrae85">168</A>]  The high    resistivity anisotropy of the
MBi-GIC's (M = a heavy  alkali metal) may offer an  important  clue.  McRae
<em> et al.</em>[<A HREF="node66.html#mcrae88">166</A>] note that  <i>rho</i><SUB>c</SUB> / <i>rho</i><SUB>a</SUB> is much higher
in the   MBi-GIC's  than in other  donor  compounds.  They interpret  their
MBi-GIC   c-axis resistivity   data in  terms   of the  hopping  conduction
mechanism  proposed  by   Sugihara.[<A HREF="node66.html#E343">229</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#M325">230</A>]    Perhaps  c-axis band
conduction in <b>s</b>-like intercalant states is necessary for the existence of
superconductivity in  GIC's.   Similar    ideas  have been     discussed by
Al-Jishi.[<A HREF="node66.html#M143">4</A>]  In  light  of   the  hypothetical CDW  state  in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg, the possibility  of a CDW should  also be taken seriously for  the
MBi-GIC's.
<P>
        These  considerations  may also apply to  the acceptor GIC's, which
also tend  to  have hopping conduction  along the c-axis.[<A HREF="node66.html#mcrae88">166</A>] The
acceptor GIC's are discussed in more detail below.
