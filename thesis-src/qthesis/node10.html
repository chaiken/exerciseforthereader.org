        The study of high-T<SUB>c</SUB> superconductors is still very
new, so the critical field properties are still being sorted out.
Even though the number of papers published on the copper oxides must
already be several times the number published on the TMDC's and the
synthetic superlattices, there are several difficulties standing in
the way of a consistent understanding of the properties of these
materials.  The principal experimental difficulty is the (currently
unobtainable) high magnetic fields needed to measure H<SUB>c2</SUB> in
an extensive temperature range, a problem which is exacerbated by the
quite broad transitions seen in a magnetic field.  Even pulsed
magnetic field experiments do not allow measurement of H<SUB>c2, _|_
^c</SUB> below about t = 0.85,[<A
HREF="node66.html#orlando87a">189</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#sakakibara87">211</A>] which means that any
conclusions drawn must be considered tentative because of the limited
magnetic field range of the data.  <P>

        The other major difficulty with the high-temperature critical
field measurements so far is the uncertain theoretical picture of
these new materials.  Until a theory of high- T<SUB>c</SUB>
superconductivity earns widespread acceptance, experimentalists must
rely on the formulae of low- T<SUB>c</SUB> superconductivity, such as
the WHHM theory and the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory (see
Section 4.5).  Interpretation of the data in terms of these models may
well be misleading, but they are the best anyone can do under the
present circumstances.  <P>

        Even with all these warnings in mind, the data that have been
published so far on the high- T<SUB>c</SUB> materials are intriguing
to those familiar with previous research on anisotropic
superconductors.  Some of the parameters from recent experiments on
the high- T<SUB>c</SUB> superconductors are gathered in Table 2.4.
The angular dependence of H<SUB>c2</SUB> measurements are the most
straighforward to interpret since they are the least affected by
magnetic field limitations.  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) data taken
so far shows that the 90 K rare-earth-barium-copper-oxide compounds
are 3D superconductors, well fit by Eqn. 4.3.
H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) results on
HoBa<SUB>2</SUB>Cu<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>x</SUB> from the work of Iye <em>
et al.</em> are shown in 2.8.

for a high- T<SUB>c</SUB> superconductor.  From Ref. [<A
HREF="node66.html#iye87a">118</A>].  Each set of symbols corresponds
to a different definition of H<SUB>c2</SUB>. For example, the curve
labeled 0.7 R <SUB>N</SUB> was obtained by plotting versus
<i>theta</i> the values of H that satisfy R(H,<i>theta</i>) = 0.7
R<SUB>N</SUB>.  Each curve is also labeled in parentheses with the
magnitude of the anisotropy parameter 1/<i>epsilon</i> that was used
for the fit to Eqn. 4.3.<p>

        A series of H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) curves taken at
different temperatures indicates that the anisotropy parameter
<i>epsilon</i> is temperature-dependendent in these materials.[<A
HREF="node66.html#iye87a">118</A>] A temperature-dependent
<i>epsilon</i> has been widely observed in layered materials such as
Nb<SUB>(1 - x)</SUB>Ta<SUB>x</SUB>Se<SUB>2</SUB>,[<A
HREF="node66.html#dalrymple84">51</A>] C<SUB>8</SUB>K[<A
HREF="node66.html#koike80">141</A>], C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg,[<A
HREF="node66.html#B340">35</A>] and Nb/Cu superlattices[<A
HREF="node66.html#chun84">42</A>], where it has been associated with
positive curvature of H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) .  As noted previously,
positive curvature of the critical field parallel to the layer planes
(_|_ to the c-axis) may be associated with a dimensionality crossover,
but the positive curvature often observed in H<SUB>c2</SUB>
perpendicular to the layer planes must have a different cause.  In the
high- T<SUB>c</SUB> superconductors, positive curvature has been
observed for both field orientations by some research groups,[<A
HREF="node66.html#iye87">119</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#iye87a">118</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#moodera88">173</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#sakakibara87">211</A>] while a linear temperature
dependence has been reported for both field orientations by others.[<A
HREF="node66.html#orlando87">188</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#orlando87a">189</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#uchida87b">255</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#vanbentum87">257</A>] Worthington <em> et al.</em>,
on the other hand, see no sign of positive curvature, but instead a
change in the linear slope of H<SUB>c2</SUB>.[<A
HREF="node66.html#worthington87">268</A>] These disagreements about
the positive curvature and temperature-dependent <i>epsilon</i> are
reminiscent of a similar controversy about NbSe<SUB>2</SUB> in the
'70's.[<A HREF="node66.html#foner73">87</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#muto73">181</A>] Whether the disparaties among the
various research groups are due to differences in sample quality or
slightly different methods of data analysis remains to be seen.  <P>

        Clearly a lot more work has to be done before the
H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) data in the copper-oxides can be understood.  One of
the major questions still to be answered is whether the
superconductivity in these materials becomes two-dimensional at low
temperatures.  The good fit of Eqn. 4.3 (rather than Tinkham's
formula) to the data suggests that the copper-oxides are 3D
superconductors at least in the temperature range accessible with
currently obtainable fields.  The coherence lengths which have been
measured so far support the identification of 3D coupling.[<A
HREF="node66.html#worthington87">268</A>] However, a decoupling of the
copper-oxygen planes is suggested by the fact that the presence of
magnetic rare earth ions between the planes does not seem to suppress
the transition temperature.[<A HREF="node66.html#tamegai87">239</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#orlando87">188</A>] Also, Table 2.4 shows that the
coherence length || to the c-axis is expected to be on the order of
the c-axis lattice constant at low-temperature, which suggests that a
coupling-dimensionality change might occur.  For example, for
HoBa<SUB>2</SUB>Cu<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>(7-y)</SUB> the c-axis lattice
parameter is 11.67 &#197;[<A HREF="node66.html#tamegai87">239</A>] and
<i>xi</i><SUB>|| ^c</SUB> is about 6.5 &#197;.  Plugging these numbers
into Eqn. 2.4 gives r = 1.58, slightly less than the critical value of
1.7.  Obviously estimates of this type are not to be taken too
seriously considering the large extrapolation.  <P>

        Another interesting question is whether the copper-oxides'
transition temperatures follow the predictions of the proximity
effect.  If the copper-oxygen planes are truly the superconducting
layers, then putting several of them together without separation by an
insulating layer should increase T<SUB>c</SUB>, according to
proximity-effect models.  Exactly this type of enhancement has been
seen in the thallium-barium-calcium-copper-oxygen superconductors,
where T<SUB>c</SUB> increases as a function of the number of
copper-oxygen planes that are adjacent.[<A
HREF="node66.html#pool88">197</A>] Of course this T<SUB>c</SUB>
behavior is not proof of proximity-effect behavior since another
mechanism could easily be responsible if the pairing in these
materials is non-conventional.  <P>

        The picture from the currently available papers on high-
T<SUB>c</SUB> superconductivity is obviously quite preliminary.  So
far they appear most like the transition metal dichalcogenides in
their critical field properties: they have an anisotropy of about 5,
H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) well-fit by Eqn. 4.3, and possible
positive curvature of H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) and temperature-dependent
anisotropy.  Even if the superconductivity of the high- T<SUB>c</SUB>
materials turns out to be mediated by an exotic interaction, the
comparison with the superconducting TMDC's and GIC's will still be
instructive.  <P>
