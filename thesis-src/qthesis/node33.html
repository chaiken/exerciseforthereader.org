	In  the following  sections  on the temperature   dependence of the
upper critical field,  the  theories of choice  for explaining the data are
those  which include   anisotropic  gap or  multiband  effects.     Logical
consistency demands  that these effects also be  considered  in attempts to
explain the anomalies in  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>).
<P>
	Many   theorists  have  calculated  the effects    of Fermi surface
anisotropy, gap anisotropy, or multiband contributions to superconductivity
on  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T).[<A HREF="node66.html#youngner80">274</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#butler80">33</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#entel76">80</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#aljishi88">5</A>]  Unfortunately,
most of  these theorists  have confined their  calculations  to one  or two
high-symmetry directions, so that a great deal  of  work remains to extract
 H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) from their equations.
<P>
        The only model to explicitly consider the  case of a  general field
orientation is  that developed by  K. Takanaka.[<A HREF="node66.html#takanaka75">238</A>] This model
incorporates  both  Fermi surface anisotropy  and  gap  anisotropy,  and is
discussed further   in  Section <A HREF="node35.html#models"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.     Takanaka  gives  a   full
expression for  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>, T) which could be used  to fit the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) data.  Takanaka's  model  was withdrawn, though, because of
the   unphysical divergence   of    H<SUB>c2</SUB>(t)   below  about  t    =
0.7.[<A HREF="node66.html#ikebe80">114</A>] While Youngner  and Klemm[<A HREF="node66.html#youngner80">274</A>]  calculated a
corrected  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) that utilized some  of Takanaka's ideas, they did
not produce an improved  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) equation.
<P>
        Despite  the  unphysical  behavior    of   Takanaka's model at  low
temperatures,  one might consider  fitting it  to the experimental  data at
high reduced temperatures.  Takanaka does show   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) curves
in Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#takanaka75">238</A>]  for t  = 0.9 which  incorporate  gap  anisotropy
effects.  Toyota <em> et al.</em>[<A HREF="node66.html#toyota76">253</A>] fit their  NbSe<SUB>2</SUB> data to
the  Takanaka  equation, but  it  is  not obvious  that  the Takanaka curve
describes   their  data  better than   the    AGL theory.  Furthermore,  if
anisotropy-induced anomalies are responsible for the deviations of the  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) data from  the AGL model,  one would  expect the
deviations  to     be       greatest   at    the      lowest        reduced
temperatures.[<A HREF="node66.html#youngner80">274</A>]   Figure <A HREF="node30.html#thetatemp"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>  shows  that      the
deviations  are in fact greater at  higher reduced temperatures,  where the
simple  AGL model should  be  most  applicable.   The reason   is that  the
assumptions that go into Ginzburg-Landau theories are justifiable only near
 T<SUB>c</SUB>,[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham80">252</A>] so if a more microscopic model  is needed to fit
the data, it should describe  low-temperature anomalies.  To put the matter
into common-sense terms, one would  expect anisotropy-derived deviations in
 H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) in the same temperature range where  the anisotropy is
causing   anomalies in   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(t), <em> i.e.</em>, at  low   reduced
temperatures.  The larger deviations from the  AGL theory at higher reduced
temperatures   is  therefore   in    conflict    with  expectations    from
anisotropic-gap and multiband  models, but consistent with type  I behavior
for small <i>theta</i>, as discussed in Section <A HREF="node30.html#typeItheta"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
        The general problem with trying  to fit more  microscopic models to
the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)  curves  is that  many parameters  (tilt,  mosaic
spread,  H<SUB>c</SUB>, <i>epsilon</i>,  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(0&#176;)) have  already been
identified as being relevant.  5  parameters is already  a large number for
slightly noisy  curves  of  about 40  or  50 points.  Considering  that the
situation is  somewhat simpler with the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) data, it is hardly
surprising that not  many  detailed theories  of  H<SUB>2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) have
appeared.
<P>
        Since the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) curves deviate  from the AGL theory
near  T<SUB>c</SUB> and the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T)  curves deviate from the AGL theory
near T=0, it does not seem too far-fetched to attribute different causes to
these anomalies.    With this   decoupling in  mind,   the  most convincing
explanation for the shape of the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) curves in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg  would seem to be that based on type I superconductivity near  <i>vec</i>H || ^c.  This explanation is embodied by Eqn. <A HREF="node30.html#typeItheta"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>,
which allows for  type I behavior.  The anomalies  in  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T)  are
discussed in the section that follows.
