        The most common method for staging determination in GIC's is
(00<i>l</i>) x-ray diffraction.[<A HREF="node66.html#I94">67</A>] This
technique was also applied to the KHg- and CsBi-GIC's, although more
for determination of the phase (<i>alpha</i> and/or <i>beta</i>) than
for identification of stage.  Mixed-stage KHg or CsBi specimens were
never at any time produced in the course of this study, although a
given stage might contain the admixture of several different phases.
The lack of stage admixture is not surprising for C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg,
which is formed from the intercalation of K and Hg vapor into
C<SUB>8</SUB>K,[<A HREF="node66.html#A157">82</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#elmakrini80">70</A>] but is somewhat surprising for
the stage I C<SUB>4</SUB>CsBi<SUB>0.5</SUB> and
C<SUB>4</SUB>CsBi<SUB>1.0</SUB>, which are formed from higher stage
CsBi-GIC's.[<A HREF="node66.html#bendriss86b">18</A>] <P>

        The presence of the peaks of only one phase in a (00<i>l</i>)
diffraction was the most common occurrence.  However, gold
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg samples sometimes contained the I<SUB>c</SUB> = 10.83
&#197; <i>beta</i> minority phase as well as the I<SUB>c</SUB> = 10.24
&#197; <i>alpha</i> majority phase.  The x-rays scans of many gold
samples contained only the majority-phase peaks, though.  Kim <em> et
al.</em> note that their experiments indicate that use of a small
temperature difference <i>Delta</i>T increases the amount of
<i>beta</i>-phase.  This finding which is consistent with Table 3.2,
which shows that gold samples are typically intercalated with a small
<i>Delta</i>T.  Predominantly <i>beta</i>-phase specimens are never
produced.[<A HREF="node66.html#lagrange83">147</A>] Occasionally
C<SUB>8</SUB>K ( I<SUB>c</SUB> = 5.35 &#197;) was also observed in the
diffraction scans of gold-colored stage I.  Samples which contained
C<SUB>8</SUB>K were never used in further experiments, though.  <P>

        The occasional presence of C<SUB>8</SUB>K in gold but not pink
samples is intriguing in light of the hypotheses presented in Section
3.2 about the synthesis of the different types of C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.
One of the ideas put forward in Section 3.2 to explain the occurrence
of gold samples was that they were the product of an incomplete
intercalation reaction.  As mentioned above, C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg is
formed from the intercalation of K and Hg vapor into C<SUB>8</SUB>K,
which forms first.[<A HREF="node66.html#timp83">249</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#elmakrini80">70</A>] If the gold samples are the
result of an incomplete reaction, one would expect to see
C<SUB>8</SUB>K peaks in gold specimens, but not in the completely
reacted pink specimens.  As noted above, this is exactly what is
observed.  <P>

        The (00<i>l</i>) scans shown here were taken using molybdenum
K<SUB><i>alpha</i></SUB> radiation with a wavelength of 0.708 &#197;.
Molybdenum radiation was chosen because it passes relatively
unattenuated through the glass tubes in which the samples were
encapsulated.  The radiation from the Mo anode passed through a
1.0&#176; horizontal collimation slit on its way to the GIC, and a
``High-Resolution'' Soller slit and 0.1&#176; vertical collimation
slit on its way to the detector, which was of the extrinsic silicon
type.  The diffractometer used is part of the Center for Materials
Science X-Ray Facility at MIT, and is of standard design.  <P>

        Typical (00<i>l</i>) scans for C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg pink (
T<SUB>c</SUB> = 1.53 K) and gold ( T<SUB>c</SUB> = 0.95 K) specimens
are shown in Figure 3.3.  These plots show intensity versus the angle
2<i>theta</i> between the incident and diffracted beams.  The
diffractograms for both the pink and gold samples show peaks from the
copper sample holders used for the low-temperature measurements
(discussed in Section 4.3) near 2<i>theta</i> = 22&#176; and broad
humps from the glass tube that surrounds the sample from about 6&#176;
to about 14&#176;.  These scans are quite similar to those shown by
Timp[<A HREF="node66.html#timp83">249</A>] and Lagrange <em> et
al.</em>[<A HREF="node66.html#lagrange80b">149</A>].  The magnitude of
I<SUB>c</SUB> was estimated from using Bragg's Law using the
separation between the most intense pair of peaks, the (002) and
(004).  The average value of I<SUB>c</SUB> obtained in these
measurements, 10.20 &#197; , is in accord with the (10.12 &#177; 0.03)
&#197; found by Timp[<A HREF="node66.html#timp83">249</A>], the 10.24
&#197; found by Univ.  of Kentucky researchers,[<A
HREF="node66.html#yang88">270</A>] and the 10.16 &#197; reported by
Lagrange.[<A HREF="node66.html#lagrange80">150</A>] However, Lagrange
shows the intensity of the (004) peak higher than the intensity of the
(002), contrary to Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#timp83">249</A>] and
Figure 3.3.  This reversal of the usual intensity ratios was seen for
some of the samples used in this study, but it appeared that the
effect was due to improper centering of the specimen on the
goniometer.  <P>

<P>Figure 3.3:</STRONG> (00<i>l</i>) x-ray scans for pink and gold
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.  The large peak near 22&#176; in each scan is from
the copper sample holder.  The broad hump from about 6&#176; to
14&#176; is due to the glass tube that the sample holder is in.  a)
I<SUB>c</SUB> = (10.22 &#177; 0.03) &#197; pink sample.  T<SUB>c</SUB>
= 1.53 K.  b) I<SUB>c</SUB> = (10.18 &#177; 0.03) &#197; gold sample.
T<SUB>c</SUB> = 0.95 K.<BR> <P> <P>

        (00<i>l</i>) x-ray diffraction was also performed before and
after hydrogenation on both pink and gold specimens.  Hydrogenation
appeared not to affect I<SUB>c</SUB>, as Figure <A
HREF="node16.html#hydxrd"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif"
SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> shows.  The scan after
hydrogenation has a larger (004) peak than (002), while the scan
before hydrogenation has a larger (002) peak.  As noted before, this
reversal appears to be an alignment-dependent effect.  Other
diffraction data taken after hydrogenation data on this sample show
the (002) peak higher.  There does not seem to be any reproducible
difference between the (00<i>l</i>) patterns before and after
hydrogenation.  <P>

<P><BR><STRONG>Figure 3.4:</STRONG> (00<i>l</i>) x-ray scans before
and after hydrogenation for a gold C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg sample.  The broad
hump from about 6&#176; to 14&#176; is due to the glass tube that the
sample is in.  Before: T<SUB>c</SUB> = 0.84 K gold C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg
sample.  I<SUB>c</SUB> = (10.24 &#177; 0.03) &#197;.  After: Same
sample as in ``Before'' picture, only after exposure to 200 torr
hydrogen gas.  T<SUB>c</SUB> = 1.535 K.  I<SUB>c</SUB> = (10.24 &#177;
0.03) &#197;.<p>

        (00<i>l</i>) scans for two CsBi-GIC's are shown in Figure 3.5.
a) shows the x-rays of a C<SUB>4</SUB>CsBi<SUB>0.5</SUB>
<i>alpha</i>-phase specimen with I<SUB>c</SUB> = 10.61 &#197;, and b)
shows a similar scan taken by Bendriss-Rerhrhaye.[<A
HREF="node66.html#bendriss86">17</A>] These scans look different
because the spectrum of Bendriss is taken with <i>theta</i> increasing
from right to left, and the MIT spectrum is taken with 2<i>theta</i>
increasing from left to right.  <i>alpha</i> + <i>beta</i>-phase
specimens were also synthesized which had an additional set of peaks
corresponding to I<SUB>c</SUB> = 11.43 &#197;.  The MIT values for
I<SUB>c</SUB> compare favorably with the (10.61 &#177; 0.02) &#197;
for <i>alpha</i>-phase and (11.48 &#177; 0.02) &#197; for
<i>beta</i>-phase reported by McRae <em> et al.</em>[<A
HREF="node66.html#mcrae86">167</A>] There is not any obvious
difference between the two sets of (00<i>l</i>)'s despite the fact
that T<SUB>c</SUB> = 4.05 K is reported for the University of Nancy
samples and T<SUB>c</SUB> <b>&lt;</b> 0.5 K for the MIT specimens.
(There are more details about the superconductivity of CsBi-GIC's in
Chapter 6.)  <P>

<STRONG>Figure 3.5:</STRONG> (00<i>l</i>) x-ray scans for
<i>alpha</i>-phase stage 1 CsBi-GIC's.  The broad hump from about
6&#176; to 14&#176; is due to the glass tube that the sample holder is
in.  a) I<SUB>c</SUB> = (10.61 &#177; 0.03) &#197; <i>alpha</i>-phase
sample.  b) Similar (00<i>l</i>) scan taken by Bendriss-Rerhrhaye.[<A
HREF="node66.html#bendriss86">17</A>] In b), <i>theta</i> is
increasing from right to left, whereas in a) 2<i>theta</i> is
increasing from left to right.<p>

        In both the case of the KHg-GIC's and the CsBi-GIC's, the
(00<i>l</i>) scans show essentially no difference between low-
T<SUB>c</SUB> and high- T<SUB>c</SUB> samples.  In an attempt to find
some structural information that would correlate with T<SUB>c</SUB>,
Raman scattering experiments were performed.  The results of these
experiments are described in the next section.  <P>
