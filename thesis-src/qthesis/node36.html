        The direct ancestor   of the KLB  papers,  and one  of the  primary
contributions to  the AGL  model,   is   the Josephson-coupling  theory  of
Lawrence and Doniach[<A HREF="node66.html#lawrence71">155</A>].   Lawrence and Doniach  started with
the idea of  a superconductor-insulator (S/I)  superlattice whose layers are
coupled by Josephson tunnelling  of quasiparticles.  They modified  the  GL
free-energy expression accordingly, and found  an effective mass along  the
c-direction in terms of  the tunnelling parameters.   From this,  following
the   work of  Kats[<A HREF="node66.html#kats69">127</A>],  they  showed  that the  critical   field
anisotropy was   equal to the square  root  of the  ratio  of the effective
masses.
<P>
        Klemm,  Luther and Beasley[<A HREF="node66.html#klemm75">131</A>]  studied  the GL equations
with Josephson-coupling further, and found that they predicted a divergence
of  H<SUB>c2, _|_ ^c</SUB>(T) at a temperature  T<SUP>*</SUP> given by  <i>xi</i><SUB>|| ^c</SUB>(T<SUP>*</SUP>) = s/<i>sqrt</i>2.  In  this equation,  s is the
interlayer spacing corresponding  to  I<SUB>c</SUB>  in GIC's.  KLB  then did  a
first-principles calculation of  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>, T) and discovered that
T<SUP>*</SUP>  is actually  the  temperature  at which  a  dimensionality crossover
occurs.  Dimensionality crossover in the context of layered superconductors
means a change in character  from  bulklike behavior to film-like behavior.
This change is  caused by  a decoupling of  the superconducting layers from
one  another when  <i>xi</i><SUB>||^c</SUB>   becomes  less  than   s.  The
symptoms  of 2D  behavior are that the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) curves are fit
with Tinkham's formula rather than the AGL  angular dependence formula, and
that  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) goes as (1 - t)<SUP>1/2</SUP> rather than the (1 - t) shape found near  T<SUB>c</SUB> in 3D superconductors.  This type of
dimensionality  crossover   has  been   experimentally   observed  both  in
TMDCIC's[<A HREF="node66.html#prober80">200</A>]   and  artificially structured superlattices (which
are   discussed   in    Chapter <A HREF="node7.html#othersys"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>).[<A HREF="node66.html#ruggiero82">208</A>]  As    an
explanation  for anomalies    in   superconducting  GIC's,   dimensionality
crossover has a lot of appeal, since so many of the normal state properties
of  GIC's are  quasi-two-dimensional.  For  example,  the anisotropy of the
conductivity    in     C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg   is    <i>sigma</i><SUB>a</SUB>/<i>sigma</i><SUB>c</SUB>   300.[<A HREF="node66.html#fischer83">85</A>]

        According   to  KLB,   a layered   superconductor   will have   the

 Calculated <b>r</b> values for a number of layered superconductors are 
shown in Tables <A HREF="#tmdcklb"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> and  <A HREF="#tmdcicklb"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  The r's  for  the  GIC
superconductors are  shown in  Fig. <A HREF="node36.html#klbgics"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  As  can easily be seen,
many  of the  transition  metal  dichalcogenide superconductors  and their
intercalation compounds  are  expected to show the dimensionality crossover
effect,  and      indeed     many  do,      as     was      discussed    in
Section <A HREF="#tmdc"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.[<A HREF="node66.html#coleman83">46</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#prober80">200</A>] On  the other  hand, the known
GIC superconductors are  more than an  order  of magnitude   away  from the
critical  value of r.    The KLB paper  found  no anomalies for <b>r</b>  >=
10,[<A HREF="node66.html#klemm75">131</A>] as  Fig. <A HREF="node36.html#klbfig"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>  shows.  Therefore,  dimensionality
effects can safely be ruled out as having any impact on the critical fields
of  the known  GIC superconductors.   This is  particularly  interesting in
light of the fact that many GIC's have anisotropies 1/<i>epsilon</i> comparable
to  those of   the  TMDCIC's.    For   example, both    C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg   and
TaS<SUB>1.6</SUB>Se<SUB>0.4</SUB>  intercalated  with   collidine have  anisotropies of
about 30, yet  the  TMDCIC is expected to  show a dimensionality crossover,
and  C<SUB>8</SUB>KHg is strongly three-dimensional even at 0 K.

        At   this   juncture  it    is   probably   wise  to   discuss  the
proximity-coupled           superlattice            models               of
superconductivity[<A HREF="node66.html#biagi85">22</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#takahashi86b">235</A>], which  have some similarities
to  the  KLB  model.  These  models    are also   capable of quantitatively
explaining  dimensional   crossover, but  in  slightly   different systems.
Proximity-coupled superlattices are  typically  superconductor-normal-metal
(SN)  multilayers, while  the  Josephson-coupled superlattices described by
the KLB theory  are typically superconductor-insulator   (S/I) multilayers.
<P>
        The motivation for making this distinction was originally explained
by     Werthamer,     and        separately       by     Saint-James    and
deGennes.[<A HREF="node66.html#werthamer63">261</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#degennes66">54</A>]  At an S/I  interface (the insulator
may be vacuum), the pairs  are confined in the superconductor  so that they
are almost unaffected by the presence of the boundary.  In this case  it is
appropriate to ignore   any variation of   the  order  parameter within the
superconducting  layers, and  to treat the interlayer  coupling  as  due to
Josephson tunnelling.[<A HREF="node66.html#lawrence71">155</A>] On  the   other  hand, at   an   S/N
interface, the pairs  can easily diffuse into the  normal metal, where they
will  be destroyed.[<A HREF="node66.html#degennes66">54</A>] The   destruction of  pairs  at an S/N
contact results in the suppression of the energy gap at the  interface, and
is one  aspect  of  the  proximity  effect.   Another  aspect  is that  the
superconductor can to some extent induce superconductivity  in a thin layer
of  the normal  metal.[<A HREF="node66.html#cooper61">49</A>]   The proximity-coupled   theories of
Takahashi   and    Tachiki[<A HREF="node66.html#takahashi86b">235</A>]   and  Biagi,    Kogan,   and
Clem[<A HREF="node66.html#biagi85">22</A>] (BKC) were developed to treat the S/N case.
<P>
        In  these  models,  the  authors parameterize  the  S and  N layers
separately, unlike the KLB theory, where the properties  of  the insulating
layers are  ignored.[<A HREF="node66.html#klemm75">131</A>] Takahashi and Tachiki[<A HREF="node66.html#takahashi86b">235</A>]
assign different densities   of    states N(0), diffusivities D,   and  BCS
interaction  energies V to the S  and N layers.    BKC, on  the other hand,
attribute to each  type of layer  a mean-free-path  <i>l</i>, superconducting
transition  temperature       T<SUB>c</SUB>,    and      Fermi  velocity   v<SUB>F</SUB>.[<A HREF="node66.html#biagi85">22</A>] Because v <SUB>F</SUB> and  <i>l</i> determine D, while N(0) and
V   determine    (with <i>Omega</i><SUB>D</SUB>)    T<SUB>c</SUB>,  it  seems  that   these
parameterizations are more or less equivalent.
<P>
        The   full   theories  both predict   positive  curvature   of  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T).  Takahashi and Tachiki found signs  of a change in the coupling
dimensionality for     H<SUB>c2, _|_ ^c</SUB>(T).[<A HREF="node66.html#takahashi86b">235</A>]
Qualitatively these results  are quite similar to those  of KLB.  The exact
criteria for dimensional crossover are  different,  though: the authors say
that the necessary condition for decoupling of  the layers  (at T <b>&gt;</b> 0) is
 s/ <i>xi</i><SUB>|| ^c</SUB>(0) >=  0.4.   This condition   is
equivalent, in terms of KLB's r-parameter, to <b>r</b> <= 31.8.  Thus the
proximity-coupled  multilayers  decouple   at   longer  coherence   lengths
(<i>xi</i><SUB>|| ^c</SUB>  = 2.5s)  than   the Josephson-coupled   ones
(<i>xi</i><SUB>|| ^c</SUB> = 1.7s).   Nonetheless, in the proximity-coupled
superlattice   models, no dimensionality     change   is  anticipated   for
superconducting  GIC's, which all exceed the  limit  in <b>r</b>  by at least  a
factor of 2.  (The possibility  of dimensionality crossover in higher-stage
GIC's is discussed in Section <A HREF="node61.html#concl"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.)  The source of this accelerated
decoupling  is not   discussed  in Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#takahashi86b">235</A>],  but  one  can
speculate that  it  comes from  the suppression of  the gap  near   the S/N
interface by the proximity effect.
<P>
        What is  even more intriguing for  those interested in GIC's is the
enhanced  critical  field  found for    <i>vec</i>H || ^c.
BKC[<A HREF="node66.html#biagi85">22</A>]  studied  only this case, and  found that ``the proximity
effect alone can produce the positive curvature [PC] in  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) ...  [despite the fact that] no  provisions were made  for anisotropy or any
other effects commonly thought to produce PC in  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T).''   These
remarks are  a little bit deceptive  in that anisotropy has been implicitly
introduced into the BKC model  through the layer thickness parameters; that
is, thin films are known to be anisotropic,  and the individual layers have
been chosen to be thin films.  Nonetheless, it  is impressive that positive
curvature has been found in a superlattice formalism which is not linked to
a dimensionality crossover.  Takahashi  and Tachiki also  found PC for  <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c.[<A HREF="node66.html#takahashi86b">235</A>]  These findings would seem to
have important implications for GIC's, for whom  a possible  explanation of
PC using dimensionality crossover has already been eliminated.
<P>
        Unfortunately there   are several problems  with applying
the  proximity-coupled    superlattice  models to   GIC's.    One
objection is that assigning  different mean-free-paths, diffusivities,  T<SUB>c</SUB>'s and  BCS interaction energies to the  S and  N layers  seems   a bit
questionable  when the  layers are only  a few atomic  layers thick.  These
models were intended to be applied to S/N  superlattices with layers on the
order  of   a few-hundred &#197;    thick,  where each of   the  constituents
individually  has transport properties  which are little  modified from the
bulk.  For layers on the order of 10 &#197;   thick, the transport properties
are so modified from the pristine materials that use of the bulk parameters
would  be highly erroneous.   The basic assumptions of the proximity-effect
models are  violated in GIC's, where  the interaction between the  host and
intercalant is  not a weak  perturbation.  Perhaps  in the  limit   of very
high-stage superconducting   GIC's (if they  exist!)   agreement   with the
proximity-coupled description might be found.
<P>
        A second reason  for  discomfort with  the KBC   and  Takahashi and
Tachiki models is the idea that superconducting  GIC's can be  described as
S/N superlattices.  While Iye and Tanuma felt that superconductivity in the
ternary GIC's was  probably  due  to superconductivity in  the  intercalant
layers,[<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>] the idea that one  component is superconducting and the
other not appears somewhat shaky when  <i>xi</i><SUB>|| ^c</SUB>   
20  I<SUB>c</SUB>, as in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.  Also, as Al-Jishi pointed out, there is
good  reason to expect    that  the  graphitic <i>pi</i>-bands contribute   to
superconductivity  in GIC's,   as  otherwise  their  large critical   field
anisotropy is difficult to explain.[<A HREF="node66.html#M143">4</A>]
<P>
        All these discussions are actually somewhat academic since the idea
that GIC's are S/N superlattices turns out not to  be self-consistent.  The
reason  is  that all  proximity-effect theories[<A HREF="node66.html#cooper61">49</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#takahashi86b">235</A>]
predict that the  T<SUB>c</SUB>'s of S/N  multilayers must always be  less than
the bulk transition temperature of the superconducting component.  In fact,
these models  predict that,   for small layer  thicknesses,  T<SUB>c</SUB> must
decline  monotonically  with increasing thickness  of the normal layer, all
other parameters being held  equal.   The monotonic  decrease of   T<SUB>c</SUB>
with increasing normal metal thickness is illustrated in Fig. <A HREF="node36.html#proxeff"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>
for  Pb/Cu bilayers.[<A HREF="node66.html#werthamer63">261</A>] Apparently no  studies of  T<SUB>c</SUB>
versus normal  metal       thickness  have been    performed   in  metallic
superlattices; the thicknesses of  both the S  and N components are usually
varied together.  (See   Figure <A HREF="node9.html#assltc"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.)  However, the  depression of
 T<SUB>c</SUB> with increasing normal  metal  thickness is also  expected in the
superlattices.   If   one  believes that  only  the  intercalant layer   is
superconducting in GIC's,  and thinks  of the carbon  (graphene) layer as a
normal metal, then one would expect a decreasing  T<SUB>c</SUB>  with increasing
stage.  Yet, as is well-known,  T<SUB>c</SUB> is higher in stage II than stage I
for   both  KHg-   and  RbHg-GIC's,[<A HREF="node66.html#iye83">116</A>]  in  contravention   to the
expectation of the model.

        The  conclusion  is that,  while the  proximity-coupled models have
been extremely  successful   in  fitting  data on  artificially  structured
superlattices (for example, those of  Nb/Ta[<A HREF="node66.html#broussard88">29</A>]), they do not
seem to  be well-suited  to  GIC's.  Perhaps if  high-stage superconducting
GIC's are ever discovered, it might be worthwhile  to  take another look at
proximity-coupling.   For  the known  GIC's, though,   it is  imperative to
consider alternative theories.
<P>
        Even though  intuition says that  the enhancement of  the  critical
fields   in superconducting GIC's  is   linked to their  anisotropy, it  is
important  to consider whether mechanisms not  related  to anisotropy could
also  play   a role.   The major causes  of  critical field enhancement  in
isotropic   superconductors are spin-orbit   scattering and strong-coupling
behavior.
