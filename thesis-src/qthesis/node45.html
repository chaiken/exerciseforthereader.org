        The impact  of   hydrogen on  superconductivity   in the transition
metals bears some  resemblance to the effect  hydrogen has on the KH-GIC's.
To be convinced of this, compare Figure <A HREF="node45.html#tmdcHfig"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>a) with the  T<SUB>c</SUB>
versus x plot  in Figure <A HREF="node44.html#khC_v"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  In  both figures  T<SUB>c</SUB>  at first
rises with increasing H content, reaching its maximum near x   0.1,
and then falls to an unmeasurably low level at high x.  ( T<SUB>c</SUB> ;SPM<SUB>l</SUB>t; 0.5
K for H<SUB>0.87</SUB>TaS<SUB>2</SUB>.[<A HREF="node66.html#murphy75">179</A>].   This data point is  not shown in
Figure <A HREF="node45.html#tmdcHfig"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.)   T<SUB>c</SUB>  also  increases slightly   for NbSe<SUB>2</SUB>
when a small amount of hydrogen is added.[<A HREF="node66.html#murphy75">179</A>]

<P>
        The resemblance between the  C<SUB>8</SUB>KH<SUB>x</SUB> and the TMDC data turns
out to be mostly coincidence since the causes are probably quite different.
The  hydrogen-induced   T<SUB>c</SUB> enhancement  in  the TMDC's  TaS<SUB>2</SUB>  and
NbSe<SUB>2</SUB> is now  known to be  due to suppression of  a charge-density  wave
transition        that      occurs       in          the     unhydrogenated
materials.[<A HREF="node66.html#murphy75">179</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#friend79">90</A>]  The charge-density  wave  can  also  be
suppressed (and consequently  T<SUB>c</SUB> can  be increased) by intercalation,
pressure,  or dopants  beside  hydrogen.[<A HREF="node66.html#friend79">90</A>]  CDW destruction by
intercalation was briefly mentioned in Section <A HREF="#tmdc"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  CDW suppression
by pressure  is  illustrated  in Figure <A HREF="node45.html#tmdcHfig"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>b) for  TaS<SUB>2</SUB>.  CDW
suppression  by pressure  is  a general phenomenon  for  the  CDW's  of the
layered TMDC's.[<A HREF="node66.html#friend79">90</A>] CDW destruction by impurities is exemplified
in the system  Nb<SUB>1-x</SUB>Ti<SUB>x</SUB>Se<SUB>3</SUB>.  NbSe<SUB>3</SUB> has   T<SUB>c</SUB>  <b>&lt;</b> 50 mK,
whereas  the compound  with  x  =  0.001 has    T<SUB>c</SUB>     2.1
K.[<A HREF="node66.html#fuller81">91</A>]  The  extreme sensitivity of   the CDW to impurities  has
understandably  resulted  in   great    reproducibility     problems   with
superconductivity in the TMDC's.[<A HREF="node66.html#fuller81">91</A>]
<P>
        The  CDW-based explanation for  T<SUB>c</SUB>  enhancement in the TMDC's
is fairly well-established because of the  observation of a  CDW in several
different    experiments.    For   example,  Figure <A HREF="node45.html#tase2resist"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>  show
discontinuities    in   the   resistivity   of  TaSe<SUB>2</SUB>     due  to a  CDW
transition.[<A HREF="node66.html#wilson74">264</A>]     There    can    be  no   doubt    that these
high-temperature resistivity anomalies are due to CDW  formation  since the
associated periodic lattice  distortion   has been directly  observed using
TEM, neutron scattering, and x-ray diffraction.[<A HREF="node66.html#friend79">90</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#wilson74">264</A>]

<BR><STRONG>Figure:</STRONG> In-plane resistivity discontinuities in TaSe<SUB>2</SUB> associated with
CDW formation.  From Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#wilson74">264</A>].   1T- and 2H- refer to different
polytypes (crystal  structures).  The CDW  transitions occur at  473  K  in
1T-TaSe<SUB>2</SUB> and   at 117   K in   2H-TaSe<SUB>2</SUB>, respectively.  Notice   that
1T-TaSe<SUB>2</SUB>  has   a higher  resistivity   below  its  transition,  whereas
the resistivity of 2H-TaSe<SUB>2</SUB> decreases at its transition.<BR>
<P>
<P>
        Except for 2H-NbS<SUB>2</SUB>, the CDW phenomenon occurs in all polytypes
of all members of the class MX<SUB>2</SUB>, where M = V, Nb, or Ta, and X = S or
Se.[<A HREF="node66.html#friend79">90</A>] Of these materials, only 2H-NbS<SUB>2</SUB> does not show a
large  T<SUB>c</SUB> enhancement with pressure.  Since NbS<SUB>2</SUB> is also the only
material which does not have a CDW transition, its comparatively small  dT<SUB>c</SUB>/dP ( only 5&#215; 10<SUP>-6</SUP> K/bar) is evidence that CDW suppression
is the cause of the  dT<SUB>c</SUB>/dP in the other MX<SUB>2</SUB>
materials.[<A HREF="node66.html#friend79">90</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#smith72">217</A>] A host of experiments show that
perturbations (such as pressure, hydrogen, and impurities) tend to rapidly
increase  T<SUB>c</SUB> up to the point where the CDW is suppressed, whereas
they affect  T<SUB>c</SUB> only slowly above the CDW transition.  For example,
NbSe<SUB>2</SUB> has a large  dT<SUB>c</SUB>/dP (4.95 &#215; 10 <SUP>-5</SUP> K/bar) for
pressures below 35 kbar, the pressure where the CDW is completely
suppressed.  Above 35 kbar, the slope is only  dT<SUB>c</SUB>/dP = 2.8 &#215; 10<SUP>-6</SUP> K/bar,   even smaller than  that in  NbS<SUB>2</SUB>.[<A HREF="node66.html#smith72">217</A>]
Obviously this is no coincidence.
<P>
           The thrust of many of the superconductivity experiments on the
TMDC's is that there is a competition between the superconducting and CDW
transitions, so that preventing one condensed state encourages the other
one.  This line of reasoning says that once the CDW is completely
suppressed by a perturbation, a material reaches its intrinsic magnitude of
 T<SUB>c</SUB>.[<A HREF="node66.html#fuller81">91</A>] By ``intrinsic'', one means the  T<SUB>c</SUB> value
that would be expected from the usual theories given <i>theta</i><SUB>D</SUB>,
<i>Lambda</i><SUB>ep</SUB>, etc.  Further application of the perturbation may then
either increase or decrease  T<SUB>c</SUB>, depending on the properties of the
individual superconductor.
<P>
        The reason that CDW's and superconductivity compete with one
another is quite simple.  In the BCS theory of superconductivity,[<A HREF="node66.html#bcs">16</A>]
the condensation energy of the superconducting state is  1/2 N(0) <i>Delta</i><SUB>s</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>, where  <i>Delta</i><SUB>s</SUB> is the superconducting energy gap.  In a
similar mean-field  theory  of   the  charge-density wave   transition, the
condensation energy is also proportional to  N(0) <i>Delta</i><SUB>CDW</SUB><SUP>2</SUP> (with
some additional multiplicative factors),[<A HREF="node66.html#rice73">204</A>] where  <i>Delta</i><SUB>CDW</SUB> is now  the CDW  energy gap.  The  juxtaposition of these two
expressions  for  the  condensation energy   immediately shows  why the two
phases tend  not to coexist: they both  need to create a gap  at the  Fermi
surface.   Once the Fermi  surface has a  gap  above it,  any further phase
transition driven  by   an  instability  of  the  Fermi  sea  is completely
suppressed.
<P>
        In real metals, a CDW transition tends to gap only a portion of the
Fermi  surface, leaving some  condensation energy available  for   use in a
superconducting  transition.  Thus a  high-temperature CDW transition tends
merely to lower  T<SUB>c</SUB> and not to  altogether prevent superconductivity.
Bilbro and  McMillan  found  a relationship between the   amount   that the
superconducting transition  temperature is lowered by  a higher-temperature
CDW phase  transition and  the amount of  Fermi surface which is removed in
that transition.[<A HREF="node66.html#bilbro76">23</A>] The relationship is:
<P>
<P><A NAME=bilbro>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img117.gif"><P>
<P>
 where  T<SUB>c</SUB> is the CDW-suppressed superconducting transition
temperature,  T<SUB>c0</SUB> is  the intrinsic  transition  temperature,  T<SUB>CDW</SUB> is the CDW onset  temperature, and  N<SUB>1</SUB>/N is the fraction of the
density-of-states  removed  in the CDW  transition.   Fuller, Chaikin,  and
Ong[<A HREF="node66.html#fuller81">91</A>] obtained N<SUB>1</SUB>/N as a function of pressure P in NbSe<SUB>3</SUB>
by measuring the size of the resistivity discontinuity at  T<SUB>CDW</SUB>(P).
The result is  N<SUB>1</SUB>/N = (0.6 - 0.18p), where p is the pressure in kbar.
Fuller and coauthors[<A HREF="node66.html#fuller81">91</A>]  used these numbers in conjunction with
Eqn. <A HREF="node45.html#bilbro"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> to fit their  T<SUB>c</SUB>(P) data, and  found good agreement
at    low   pressures.
<P>
        This  agreement   is convincing evidence   that  CDW-suppression of
superconductivity is indeed  due  to the competition of the  two  condensed
phases for the Fermi surface.  Any perturbation of the materials that tends
to  suppress the CDW,   such as pressure,  hydrogenation, or intercalation,
will therefore  also tend to  increase  T<SUB>c</SUB>.   The enhancement of  T<SUB>c</SUB> by hydrogenation in  the  TMDC's obviously is  due to a very different
mechanism than that which  has been put forward  for the transition  metals
and the alkali-metal  GIC's.  Since  hydrogen   first  increases and   then
depresses  T<SUB>c</SUB>  in  C<SUB>8</SUB>K, one  might wonder  whether  CDW's might
also play a role.  This  possibility  is discussed below in connection with
the  results   on the  KHg-GIC's.   Before   relating the  outcome   of the
hydrogenation experiments on the KHg-GIC's, the details  of the experiments
are briefly described.
