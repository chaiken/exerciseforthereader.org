	The  superconducting  transitions  were  measured by monitoring the
ac susceptibility  of the sample  as  the temperature or  magnetic
field was swept.  An ac inductance bridge  was used to record  the sample's
susceptibility.   The homemade inductance  bridge,   which is  sketched  in
Figure <A HREF="node26.html#ibridge"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, was composed of a  primary  solenoid, around which
two counterwound secondary solenoids about  half the length  of the primary
were placed.  The  secondaries were balanced  to within about  2 microvolts
under the typical operating conditions of the experiment.   The off-balance
voltage included contributions from the sample holder and small unavoidable
differences between the secondaries.  This voltage was nulled  by using the
zero adjust knob on  the  lock-in amplifier (see   Figure <A HREF="node26.html#schematic"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>)
before  the field  and  temperature  sweeps    began.   Several   different
versions of the  inductance bridge were  used in the early zero-field
experiments,  but  all critical  field measurements  reported here were done
with the same unit.

	The fraction of a sample which is  superconducting can be estimated
in the inductive measurements because the transition height is proportional
to the fraction  of the primary coil which  is  filled with superconducting
material.  The exact expression, from Faraday's Law in cgs units, is:<BR>
<P>
<P><A NAME=vbridge>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img41.gif"><P>
<P>
 where  V<SUB>secondary</SUB> is the superconducting transition
height,  A is the  effective area of   the  superconducting material in the
direction perpendicular to the  primary  modulation field,  B<SUB>mod</SUB> is
the  modulation field, and   <i>Omega</i><SUB>mod</SUB> is the modulation frequency.
The dependence on the area perpendicular to the modulation field comes from
the fact that this area determines the time-rate of change of magnetic flux
in Faraday's Law.   Here <i>alpha</i> is a  dimensionless constant of the order
of unity which takes into account the  coupling of the  primary coil to the
secondary.  This constant can in principle  be calculated[<A HREF="node66.html#abel64">2</A>], but
in practice it is preferable to simply measure   alpha  by filling the
primary coil completely with a superconducting material, so that  A  =  A<SUB>coil</SUB>.  Once <i>alpha</i>  is determined in this  way, a measurement of the
transition   height for a    given   specimen  gives   its  superconducting
cross-sectional area.  From   knowledge of  the  sample's total    area, an
estimate   of the   fraction which  is   superconducting  (fraction =   A<SUB>superconducting</SUB>/ A<SUB>total</SUB>) can be made, as discussed below.
<P>
	It is important to note that this  areal fraction is an upper bound
on  the <em> volume</em> fraction  of superconductivity.  To  see why, consider
the case where the modulation field is applied along ^z, so that the
contribution to the signal comes from planes of constant <b>z</b> from <b>z</b>=0 to <b>z</b>=L.
[See Figure <A HREF="node26.html#scingfract"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.]  Portions  of the  sample  at  all positions
along the coil axis can contribute  equally  to the effective  area.  For a
given position  (x,y)  in the  cross-section,  though,  only  one  volume
element can contribute.  This volume element  will screen all others at the
same (x,y) position, so that A is really the area of the projection along
^z of   all the superconducting   volume  elements  onto a  plane of
constant <b>z</b>. Therefore  the cases where 100%  of the volume superconducts
and just one full sheet (say  that  at  <b>z</b>=L)  superconducts cannot be
distinguished by this technique.
<P>
        The inductance  bridge used  in the critical field measurements was
calibrated by filling its end with aluminum foil.  The foil had a  T<SUB>c</SUB>
of    1.1 K    (in      surprisingly   good   agreement    with   tabulated
values[<A HREF="node66.html#ashcroft76">10</A>])  with  a  transition height   of 38 <i>mu</i>V.    The
thermal drift of the inductance bridge off-balance  is about 50 nV/K, so it
is estimated that the minimum observable transition height is about 100 nV.
From the known area  of  the primary coil  of 50.3 mm<SUP>2</SUP>, it was estimated
that the transition height of a  typical  GIC should be  about 5 <i>mu</i>V, as
was indeed the case.  Thus the  inductive experiment should be sensitive to
superconductivity in  about   2%  of  a  typical sample.    Unfortunately,
repositioning a  large  GIC inside the  primary coil changed its transition
height  by as  much as a  factor of 5.  This  variation occurs because  the
secondary coil  is not much longer than  the sample,  and the  secondary is
much  more  sensitive to inductance changes near  its  center than near its
end.  A   larger  inductance bridge  could not  be accomodated  inside  the
available <SUP>3</SUP>He refrigerators.

	As  a practical  matter, the  GIC's used in   these experiments are
thought to  be fairly homogeneous  on a  macroscopic  scale.   Therefore, in
general   the  effective   areal fraction of   superconductivity  should be
approximately  the volume one  as well.  In the cases  where the GIC's were
multiphased, the matter of  superconducting volume  and  screening deserves
more thought, as discussed in Section <A HREF="node46.html#khghydexp"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
	The   full    data       acquisition system    is     sketched   in
Figure <A HREF="node26.html#schematic"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  The primary excitation current  was supplied by an
oscillator,   either one inside the lock-in   amplifier, or an external one
attached to the lock-in's reference port.  The usual excitation current was
1 milliampere at 490 Hz. This frequency was chosen because  it seemed to be
particularly   free of electrical noise.   Neither  the critical fields nor
 T<SUB>c</SUB> obtained from this apparatus were found to be sensitive to either
the magnitude or frequency  of the  primary current.  The  primary magnetic
field  produced under  this excitation  was calculated  to be 0.17 oersteds
(compared to the 0.2  oersteds at 27 Hz  used in Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>]).  These
conditions were sufficient to give a typical signal-to-noise ratio of about
1000, with the superconducting transition height usually  between  5 and 10
microvolts.   The  detailed theory  of operation of  an   inductance bridge
circuit is described in Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#abel64">2</A>].
<P>
	The  output signal of  the inductance bridge   was filtered  by the
lock-in,  and the lock-in's  output was  fed to the  y-input  of  a flatbed
plotter.  The x-input for temperature sweeps  was either the voltage across
a calibrated germanium resistor (Lake Shore  GR-200A-100), or the dc output
of  a capacitive pressure sensor (MKS  Baratron) which was  attached to the
<SUP>3</SUP>He refrigerator.  The temperature derived  from the pressure sensor was
in   excellent    agreement  (the disagreement  about    the   same as  the
interpolation error) with that obtained from the germanium resistor down to
about 1.0 K, below  which deviations increased with decreasing temperature.
At  the lowest  temperatures (T     0.4 K), the germanium  resistor
consistently showed  readings about 30%  higher than those of  the  <SUP>3</SUP>He
vapor pressure under hard pumping, with the  thermometer reaching agreement
with the vapor pressure  to within a  few percent  after  about  one hour's
wait.  The  implication   here  is that   a well-calibrated thermometer  is
essential for work below 1.0 K.  At the lowest temperatures, the reading of
the thermometer   was    always    recorded   in     preference    to   the
vapor-pressure-derived    temperature.  The    magnetoresistance   of   the
thermometer was negligible throughout the magnetic field range of interest,
and was not corrected for.
<P>
	Besides the question of agreement between the  temperature sensors,
there is also the problem  of thermal equilibrium  between  the temperature
sensors and the sample.  The sample tube contained about 200 torr of helium
gas  intended to provide  thermal contact of  the GIC  to the  bath  and to
minimize any temperature lag.   Furthermore, the sample  was allowed to sit
at constant temperature for about five minutes prior to each field sweep if
the temperature had been changed.   The actual degree of equilibration that
was  achieved with  these  precautions can  be estimated  by comparing  the
values of  T<SUB>c</SUB> obtained in heating and cooling temperature sweeps.  In
general, the offset between the values of  T<SUB>c</SUB> measured in heating and
cooling  was on the  order  of  10 mK,  indicating that equilibrium between
temperature sensors and sample was nearly achieved.  The offset between the
sensors   and the  GIC is probably   the  largest  source of  error in  the
determination   of   T<SUB>c</SUB>   for reasonably  narrow   superconducting
transitions.  This offset is also   one of the most   important sources  of
error in  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) measurements at low temperatures.
<P>
	The magnetic field was supplied  by a  set of homemade water-cooled
copper Helmholtz coils about 2 feet in diameter and separated by  about the
same distance.  No  difficulties with hysteresis were  encountered in using
this magnet.  With the largest  available  power supply, a  pair of Hewlett
Packard Model 8012A supplies connected in series, the magnet could be swept
up to a field of about 1000 oersteds at about  30  amperes, which was adequate
for  the    C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg  critical  field   measurements.   The field was
calibrated with a Hall  probe against the output of  a potentiometer on the
sweep control of the power supply.  This  sweep control was  built by Bruce
Brandt of the National Magnet Laboratory.  No effort was made to screen out
the  earth's field,  as its contribution to   the  experimental  errors was
thought to be inconsequential overall.  The largest source of inaccuracy in
the critical field measurements was in the  field calibration, as the exact
value of  the  field  inside  the  Helmholtz  coils was position-sensitive,
varying by  as much as  10% over the distance of  an inch.  However, since
the field versus potentiometer  calibration is linear,  any inaccuracies in
sample position or calibration should change only the magnitude of the data
curves, not their shape.  Because of the possible errors in sample mounting
and field calibration, it is estimated  that the critical  field at a given
orientation and  temperature  could  be  off by as  much  as 15%   in either
direction.  However,  the  ratio of the  values  of  H<SUB>c2</SUB>  at  two
different  angles or temperatures  is   known considerably more accurately,
perhaps to within about &#177; 5% of the measured value.
<P>
	Most of the  data described in  this chapter were obtained  using a
<SUP>3</SUP>He closed-cycle refrigeration system   built  by  Mike  Blaho   of  the
National  Magnet Laboratory.   The inductance  bridge   was attached to   a
standard <SUP>3</SUP>He probe loaded into a <SUP>3</SUP>He refrigerator  which was immersed
into a  <SUP>4</SUP>He  bath.  The   germanium resistor was  glued  directly to the
bridge in  order  to  insure   good  thermal contact  to  the  sample.  The
recirculation system and refrigerator are of standard design.[<A HREF="node66.html#betts76">20</A>]
Some of the data above 0.9 K were taken in a single-shot  <SUP>4</SUP>He evaporator
cryostat.  No  discrepancy was    found  between   these  and  the   <SUP>3</SUP>He
experiments.
