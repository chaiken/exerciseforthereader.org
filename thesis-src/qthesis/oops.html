	The transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) were the  first layered
superconductors to be intensively studied.   The observation of anisotropic
superconductivity in these  materials  is  not surprising considering  that
they contain some   of the transition   metal elements (Nb, Ta)  that  show
anisotropic   superconductivity   in  bulk form.   As  it   turns out,  the
properties  of the  TMDC's  are   qualitatively  similar  to those  of  the
transition metals on which they are based, only with a larger anisotropy.<p>

Values of the KLB parameter <i>r</i> (defined in Eqn. 2.4) for a
number of transition metal dichalcogenides.  <i>r</i> < 1.7 means that
a 3D-2D crossover will occur at a finite temperature.  s is the layer
repeat distance, which is equivalent to I<sub>c</sub> for GIC's. NR
means that this parameter was not reported in the indicated
reference.<p>

        Table 2.1 shows selected properties of some of the TMDC
superconductors.  Interest in the TMDC's derives partly from their
highly anisotropic critical fields (<i>epsilon</i>) as large as
13.7.\cite{coleman83}) H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data for the
prototypical TMDC superconductor, NbSe<sub>2</sub> are shown in Figure
2.1 along with a fit to the square of Eqn. 2.1.<p>

        Besides their anisotropy, the other prominent feature of the
TMDC results is the unusual temperature dependence of their critical
fields.  Nearly all of the TMDC's and their intercalation compounds
show an extended linearity or positive curvature of their critical
fields.[267] That is, H<sub>c2</sub>(T) does not show the
low-temperature saturation expected from the standard WHHM theory.
This deviation from the usual theory occurs despite the fact that the
TMDC's are 3D superconductors, albeit highly anisotropic ones.  The
unusual shape of the TMDC data are best displayed by plotting
h<sup>*</sup> = H<sub>c2</sub> / (dH<sub>c2</sub>/dT X T<sub>c</sub>)
versus t (= T/T<sub>c</sub>) since this plot should yield a universal
curve for superconductors describable by the WHHM theory.[108] An
h<sup>*</sup> versus t plot for
Nb<sub>1-x</sub>Ta<sub>x</sub>Se<sub>2</sub> samples is shown in
Figure 2.2.  The linear behavior of the data causes it to deviate
above the dashed and solid curves that show typical low-temperature
saturation.[210,186] H<sub>c2</sub> also deviates above the WHHM
prediction in the transition metals, although the effect there is
smaller.[129]<p>

        Two types of superconducting TMDCIC's have been studied: one
variety intercalated with alkali metal and alkaline earth atoms, and
another class intercalated with large organic molecules.  The first
group are qualitatively similar to the pristine TMDC superconductors,
only with larger angular anisotropy and greater positive curvature of
H<sub>c2</sub>(T).[266] The alkali-metal intercalation compounds based
on the TMDC's appear to be 3D superconductors, just like the
alkali-metal GIC's.[240] Table 2.2 shows, the three-dimensionality of
the alkali intercalates of the TMDC's is demonstrated by their value
of <i>r</i> >= 3.0.  Therefore in going from the transition metals to
the TMDC's to the alkali-intercalated TMDC's, qualitatively the same
behavior is seen.  As the number of non-superconducting layers between
the transition metal layers is increased, the main trend is increasing
positive curvature of the critical fields.<p>

        The alkali intercalation compounds of MoS<sub>2</sub> are of
particular interest to those working with GIC's since MoS<sub>2</sub>
is a semiconductor, but its intercalation compounds are metals with
T<sub>c</sub> on the order of 4-6 K.[220] Thus the alkali-metal
intercalates of MoS<sub>2</sub> are superconducting despite the fact
that neither of the starting materials is superconducting, a situation
much like that of the alkali-metal GIC's.[102] As in the alkali-metal
GIC's, the occurrence of superconductivity in the
alkali-metal/MoS<sub>2</sub> compounds is attributed to charge
transfer from the alkali <i>s</i>-bands to the bands of the host
material.[220]<p>

Values of the KLB parameter <i>r</i> for a number of transition metal
dichalcogenide intercalation compounds.  <i>s</i> is the layer repeat
distance, which is equivalent to $\rm I_c$ for GIC's.  Dagger means
that the value of <i>r</i> was calculated from parameters in the cited
references. NR means the parameter was not reported in the cited
reference.<p>

        The transition metals which are themselves superconducting
also show anomalous effects upon intercalation.  The intercalation of
organic molecules into several TMDC's, such as NbS<sub>2</sub>,[92]
TaSe<sub>1.6</sub>Se<sub>0.4</sub>,[200] and TaSeS[175] depresses
T<sub>c</sub>.  This depression is expected according to
proximity-effect theories[54,49] which say that layering a
superconductor with an insulator should lower T<sub>c</sub>.  On the
other hand, intercalation of organic molecules into other TMDC's such
as TaS<sub>2</sub>, TaSe<sub>2</sub>, and PdTe<sub>2</sub> actually
increases T<sub>c</sub>.[92] The compounds whose T<sub>c</sub> was
enhanced by intercalation were later found to be charge-density wave
(CDW) materials.[264,50] Since superconductivity and CDW's both get
their condensation energy from the opening of a gap on the Fermi
surface, they are competing ground states of the system.  Therefore
any modification (such as intercalation) that can suppress the CDW
enhances superconductivity.  CDW's are quite common in layered
materials.[90] The possibility of a CDW in the KHg-GIC's[55] will be
discussed further in Chapter 5.<p>

        Unlike the alkali-intercalated TMDC's, the
organic-molecule-intercalated TMDC's show qualitatively different
behavior from their parent compounds in the form of a transition from
3D to 2D coupling.[46,200] The 3D-2D crossover is manifested as a kink
in the H<sub>c2</sub> perp c(T) curves, as shown in Figure 2.3a).
Examination of the data shows that the shape of the curve does in fact
change from approximately linear with temperature to approximately the
square-root of temperature behavior expected in the 2D limit.  The
data is well-described by the KLB model of dimensionality
change.[131]<p>

        As discussed in the previous section, the two signatures of 2D
coupling are a square-root of T temperature dependence and a Tinkham's
formula angular dependence for H<sub>c2</sub>.
H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data for methylamine-intercalated
TaS<sub>2</sub> are shown in Figure 2.3b) along with a fit to
Eqn. 4.3.[46] The fit is much better in the 3D regime (T >
T<sup>*</sup>) than in the 2D regime (T < T<sup>*</sup>), as one would
expect.  Unfortunately none of the research groups who have done
extensive research on the TMDCIC's seem to have fit their data in the
2D regime to Tinkham's formula.[46,200]<p>

	The primary result of the critical field experiments on the
TMDC's and their intercalation compounds was the first observation of
a dimensionality crossover.  The other notable findings are
measurement for the first time of a large critical field anisotropy,
and the observation of positive curvature in H<sub>c2</sub>(T) both
with and without an associated dimensionality crossover.  The TMDCIC
experiments are, however, limited by several factors.  One is crystal
quality: the samples tend to be "wrinkled" and may include several of
the stable polytypes.[200] These inhomogeneities will obviously impact
negatively upon any anisotropy measurements.  The other problem with
the TMDCIC experiments is that the critical field anisotropy is so
large that accurate measurements of H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)
become quite difficult for <i>theta</i> near 90&#176;.  Both of these
difficulties are lessened with the advent of the artificially
structured superlattices described in the next section.
