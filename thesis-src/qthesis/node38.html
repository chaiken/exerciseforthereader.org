        There are  two-types of models which  take anisotropy as a point of
departure,  rather  than  treating   it as  a  small  perturbation,  as the
pioneering  Hohenberg and Werthamer  model did.[<A HREF="node66.html#hohenberg67">111</A>] One class
consists  of models   that consider a   single non-spherical  Fermi surface
and/or    energy     gap.     This      category    includes     work    by
Takanaka,[<A HREF="node66.html#takanaka75">238</A>] Pohl  and    Teichler,[<A HREF="node66.html#pohl76">195</A>] Youngner and
Klemm,[<A HREF="node66.html#youngner80">274</A>]    Butler,[<A HREF="node66.html#butler80">33</A>]     and   Prohammer   and
Schachinger.[<A HREF="node66.html#prohammer87">201</A>]  The  other   class  of theories  study  the
implications of  two different  Fermi   surface pieces that  contribute  to
superconductivity.  These models    have  been  developed   by  Entel   and
Peter,[<A HREF="node66.html#entel76">80</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#entel77">81</A>]          Decroux,[<A HREF="node66.html#decroux80">52</A>],         and
Al-Jishi[<A HREF="node66.html#M143">4</A>].
<P>
        Theories   in  the   first class, consisting   of  the  anisotropic
gap/Fermi surface  models,  are essentially extensions   of the  AGL  model
discussed   previously.   That   is, these theories  contain  the essential
physics  of  the AGL model  plus  modifications  describing what are called
non-local  effects.    ``Non-local''   is an   adjective that     refers to
clean-limit  phenomena outside  the the   scope of Ginzburg-Landau theories
which  are  related  to the    finite   spatial extent   of   the    Cooper
pair.[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham80">252</A>] That the more complex models reduce to  the AGL model
in   the      local     limit   is   demonstrated   by      Hohenberg   and
Werthamer.[<A HREF="node66.html#hohenberg67">111</A>]  What Hohenberg and    Werthamer  did  was  to
rewrite  the  eigenvalue   equation   for  the  energy   gap  (which is  an
intermediate step in the  derivation of the  Helfand-Werthamer equation for
 H<SUB>c2</SUB>) in terms  of an infinite sum.   The sum has terms which  are
matrix elements of even powers  of a quantity  proportional to  <i>vec</i>v <i>cdot</i> <i>vec</i><i>pi</i>, where <i>vec</i>v is  the Fermi velocity and  <i>vec</i><i>pi</i> == <i>hbar</i>/i <i>vec</i><i>nabla</i> - e/c <i>vec</i>A  is  the  gauge-invariant   momentum   operator.  Because  of  the
relationship between  the vector potential   <i>vec</i>A and  the magnetic
field,  it   turns out   that  the component  of  <i>vec</i>v  parallel to
<i>vec</i><i>pi</i>  is   orthogonal to  the applied  field,   in  keeping with the
expectation from the GL  theory that transport in  a plane perpendicular to
the applied field determines  H<SUB>c2</SUB>.  The important  quantity in this
formalism is
<P>
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img101.gif"><P>
<P>
 where the integral is to be taken over the FS.   Here  <i>vec</i>q 
is a point on the Fermi surface,  N(<i>vec</i>q) is the  density of states
at that point,  and  v<SUB>_|_ ^H</SUB> (<i>vec</i>q)  is the component of
 <i>vec</i>v<SUB>F</SUB>(<i>vec</i>q)   perpendicular    to   <i>vec</i>H.  Obviously   the
critical field anisotropy is uniquely specified  by one parameter <i>epsilon</i>
only if  the  FS  is   ellipsoidal.  Otherwise  knowledge  of the entire FS
geometry is needed.  Notice that  v<SUB>_|_ <i>vec</i>H</SUB> (<i>vec</i>q) depends
not only on the magnitude of  <i>vec</i>v<SUB>F</SUB> at the point  <i>vec</i>q, but also on the angle between the angle between  <i>vec</i>H and
 <i>vec</i>v<SUB>F</SUB>(<i>vec</i>q).  This point   is illustrated by Fig. <A HREF="node38.html#perpexplain"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>
from Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#dalrymple83">50</A>].

<BR><STRONG>Figure:</STRONG> Illustration of how  v<SUB>_|_ <i>vec</i>H</SUB> (<i>vec</i>q) changes as

 <i>vec</i>q is the coordinate of a point on the  Fermi surface.  B is Dalrymple's
anisotropy  parameter, which  is   equivalent  to <i>epsilon</i>  in   the  AGL
model.[<A HREF="node66.html#dalrymple83">50</A>]<BR>
<P>
<P>
        Hohenberg and Werthamer   went on to  show that  keeping  only  the
zeroth-order term  in the infinite  sum gives  the isotropic theory,  while
keeping terms  up  to the second  order in the  dot  product  gives the AGL
model,          including      Eqn. <A HREF="node28.html#ldtheor"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>           for         H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>).[<A HREF="node66.html#decroux82">53</A>]  What   all  subsequent models of   FS/gap
anisotropy do is to  include more terms in  the   sum over powers  of ( <i>vec</i>v <i>cdot</i> <i>vec</i><i>pi</i>).  Increasingly higher-order terms correspond both to higher degrees of
non-locality,   and  because   of symmetry,  also  to  more complex  FS/gap
geometries  (<em> i.e.,</em>  higher  angular momentum  spherical harmonics).
Hohenberg   and  Werthamer         included     fourth-order  contributions
perturbatively,[<A HREF="node66.html#hohenberg67">111</A>] which corresponds to  the weak-anisotropy
limit.   The weak-anisotropy limit  is probably  less appropriate for GIC's
than for superconductors like niobium  or vanadium, which have 1/<i>epsilon</i>
on the  order of 2 or  3.  The Hohenberg  and Werthamer model only modifies
 H<SUB>c2</SUB>(t) near   T<SUB>c</SUB>, and cannot  produce the low-t enhancement
observed in GIC's.
<P>
        Takanaka  included  terms up to  order four  in  a non-perturbative
manner,   but his  theory   is limited   to  t     1 because of  an
error.[<A HREF="node66.html#youngner80">274</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#ikebe80">114</A>] Youngner and Klemm, who fit their equations
to  NbSe<SUB>2</SUB> data, found a way  to  sum the  series  exactly up to infinite
order.[<A HREF="node66.html#youngner80">274</A>]   They remark   that    their  model  is  basically
equivalent  to  that  of   Pohl   and   Teichler,    who    fit   data   on
vanadium.[<A HREF="node66.html#pohl76">195</A>] These models  are also very  similar to  the work of
Butler,[<A HREF="node66.html#butler80">33</A>] who applied    his theory  to  niobium, except  that
Butler dropped  all  terms due   to gap anisotropy  in  his final equations
because he thought were quite small.  Butler's equations have also been used
by  Dalrymple  and  Prober[<A HREF="node66.html#dalrymple84">51</A>]       to   fit    data      on
Nb<SUB>1-x</SUB>Ta<SUB>x</SUB>Se<SUB>2</SUB>.
<P>
        From examination of the   h<SUP>*</SUP> versus t curves  that  appear in
either  Butler's    paper[<A HREF="node66.html#butler80">33</A>]     or   Youngner   and    Klemm's
paper,[<A HREF="node66.html#youngner80">274</A>]  it is clear   that either   one  can produce  both
extended  linearity  using an  ellipsoidal Fermi surface   model.   This is
encouraging  because the  <i>pi</i>-bands of GIC's  are  generally  believed to
produce an ellipsoidal FS piece,[<A HREF="node66.html#I94">67</A>] but it  is  not the whole story.
A   calculation  using     Butler's  equations      taken from  Dalrymple's
thesis[<A HREF="node66.html#dalrymple83">50</A>] is shown in Fig. <A HREF="node38.html#butlerellipse"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  Notice that
 h<SUP>*</SUP>(t) is enhanced only  when  Dalrymple's parameter B  (which is the
same for an ellipsoidal Fermi surface as <i>epsilon</i> from the  AGL model) is
less than one,   and that  h<SUP>*</SUP>(0)  is  actually suppressed  from   the
isotropic  value when B is greater  than one.   The   significance  of this
conclusion is that for a simple ellipsoidal  FS,  the Butler model extended
linearity gives only for one field orientation.[<A HREF="node66.html#dalrymple83">50</A>] Therefore
one cannot describe critical field enhancement for both  field orientations
using a simple ellipsoidal FS.

parameter B is  equivalent to 1/<i>epsilon</i> in the  AGL model.  The B  = 1.0

        Because Dalrymple and Prober observed  enhanced critical fields for
NbSe<SUB>2</SUB> for both  <i>vec</i>H || ^c  and  <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c,[<A HREF="node66.html#dalrymple84">51</A>]  they tried fitting  their  data
with  more complex   Fermi   surface  geometries.  When   they  combined an
ellipsoid     with  a cylindrical   FS    model calculated   by Wexler  and
Woolley[<A HREF="node66.html#wexler76">263</A>], they found excellent quantitative agreement between
theory and  experiment  for     <i>vec</i>H || ^c,   and good
qualitative agreement  for  <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c.[<A HREF="node66.html#dalrymple83">50</A>]
These fits are shown in  Fig. <A HREF="node38.html#nbse2fit"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  In order to get quantitative
agreement for  <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c, the authors had to  multiply all
the data through by a factor of  2.1.  Dalrymple  and Prober explained that
this factor was necessary  because  of mean-free-path anisotropy, which  is
not taken into  account in the Butler   model.   The mean-free  path <i>l</i>
comes  in  because of  the dependence of   H<SUB>c2</SUB> on the diffusivity D
==   1/3 v<SUB>F</SUB> <i>l</i>.    This type of  mean-free-path anisotropy is
quite believable  since    much larger ratios   have often    been seen  in
GIC's.[<A HREF="node66.html#mcrae88">166</A>] Essentially Dalrymple  and Prober find that the Butler
model describes  H<SUB>c2, || ^c</SUB> data without  correction.
This agreement occurs  since in-plane transport  in  NbSe<SUB>2</SUB> is clean, and
Butler's model is for clean-limit superconductors.  The  Butler model needs
a correction to fit  H<SUB>c2, _|_ ^c</SUB> data because transport along  ^c is dirty.

<P>
        Youngner and Klemm's model of  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) seems to be  the same
as Butler's, but with the added feature of gap anisotropy.[<A HREF="node66.html#youngner80">274</A>]
In  this  case,  <i>vec</i>v(<i>vec</i>q) <i>cdot</i> <i>vec</i><i>pi</i> may still depend on
 <i>vec</i>q.  In addition,  though, the  states between which the matrix
element  of  <i>vec</i>v <i>cdot</i> <i>vec</i><i>pi</i>  is evaluated may also themselves
be non-spherical.  Youngner's model  produces curves quite similar to those
of  Butler, including  extended linearity and  positive  curvature for some
choices   of   parameters.     The  recent    theory   of    Prohammer  and
Schachinger[<A HREF="node66.html#prohammer87">201</A>] is nearly  the same as  Youngner and  Klemm's
model, only   these  authors  consider electron-phonon  coupling anisotropy
rather than explicit gap anisotropy.
<P>
        As if these weren't already enough  models, there are also theories
which     consider the  effect   of   multiple    bands     contributing to
superconductivity.  The most extensive of these was developed by  Entel and
Peter.[<A HREF="node66.html#entel76">80</A>] A two-band model  fit by Entel and  Peter to  data  on
Cs<SUB>0.1</SUB>WO<SUB>2.9</SUB>F<SUB>0.1</SUB>,  a tungsten  fluoroxide  bronze,  is shown  in
Fig. <A HREF="node38.html#entelfit"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.    Decroux and   Fischer   advocate   the use  of  the
Entel-Peter  model   for fits       to  ternary  molybdenum    chalcogenide
data.[<A HREF="node66.html#decroux82">53</A>]  The main  parameters  which   determine the critical
field enhancement in this theory are the interband and intraband scattering
times.   Al-Jishi[<A HREF="node66.html#M143">4</A>]  has proposed a  theory quite similar to Entel
and Peter's, but his critical field calculations are still in a preliminary
phase.   In GIC terms, these   models  propose  that  intercalant  and
graphitic bands   both contribute  to  superconductivity.   This   idea was
originally suggested by Al-Jishi,[<A HREF="node66.html#M143">4</A>] and  it is supported by a large
amount of experimental evidence, as is described in Section <A HREF="node58.html#csbidisc"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.

<P>
        The profusion of models which  predict an enhanced   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T)
is quite confusing,  especially  since both the multiband  and  anisotropic
gap/FS theories seem  to have features  which are very  sensible for GIC's.
Prohammer and Schachinger say in  their recent paper[<A HREF="node66.html#prohammer87">201</A>]  that
the   Entel-Peter model  and the  anisotropic gap/FS   models are  actually
equivalent, really amounting to different   parameterizations of  the  same
phenomena.    Considering  the   similarities    of    the   curves      in
Figs. <A HREF="node38.html#nbse2fit"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> and <A HREF="node38.html#entelfit"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, this is not too surprising.
<P>
        The question of whether these models  will explain the anomalies in
GIC   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T)  data, ranging  from  the extended linearity  of   C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg to  the  positive  curvature of  C<SUB>8</SUB>RbHg, still  has not been
directly addressed.  Clearly  all of the multiband and   anisotropic gap/FS
theories  are capable of   producing  curves of the  right  shape, but this
doesn't mean that they would  give good  fits to  the data using reasonable
FS/gap parameters.  Unfortunately,  no complete  theoretical Fermi  surface
computation  for the ternary GIC's is   available, and  there  is only
limited   knowledge  about    the   normal-state    transport   properties.
Holzwarth[<A HREF="node66.html#holzwarth88">112</A>] has  calculated  the   band structure  of   C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg,  but published  only  a qualitative sketch  of the  Fermi surface.
This sketch  is reproduced in  Fig. <A HREF="node38.html#holzfs"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.   If Holzwarth  publishes
quantitative information about the FS of  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg, or,  even better, FS
information for   C<SUB>8</SUB>RbHg, then a  fit could be made  to  the critical
field data.  Obviously this hypothetical fit would be the decisive  test of
the applicability of these models.

nearly  cylindrical symmetry at the  corner of  a hexagonal Brillouin zone,
and both have higher masses for transport along  k<SUB>z</SUB> than in the layer
planes.   The  hexagonal solid line   is   the Brillouin zone;  the roughly
triangular pieces drawn with a solid line at the  corners of the BZ are the
graphitic <i>pi</i> bands.    The pieces  drawn with a  dotted line  are due  to
mercury bands.  The small circular zone-center part is from  Hg 6<b>s</b> holes;
the  hexagonal  portion  is  from  Hg 6p<i>pi</i>   electron carriers; and  the
trigonal pieces at the zone corner are derived from H 6p<i>sigma</i> bands.<BR>

<P>
        Lamentably an attempt to invert the critical  field data to predict
the geometry  of the Fermi  surface is not justified  by the critical field
data  which  is available.  In principle  at  least, if  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) had
been measured at a large number of angles <i>theta</i>, this inversion could be
performed.
<P>
        What conclusions can  be drawn  about  the appropriateness  of  the
anisotropic gap/FS or multiband models for  GIC's in the  absence of a fit?
On  the plus side, these  models contain features  compatible  with what is
already  known about GIC's: GIC's  have highly anisotropic  Fermi surfaces;
they are more disordered along the c-axis than in-plane; they have multiple
bands present at the Fermi surface; and their   h<SUP>*</SUP>(t) curves are much
like those  of the transition metal dichalcogenides  for whom most  of  the
models  were intended.   Therefore the  tentative  conclusion is  that  GIC
superconductivity is  described by  one  of these  theories,   although for
positive confirmation, fits to the data are still needed.
