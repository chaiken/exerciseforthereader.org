	The techniques used in the  T<SUB>c</SUB> measurements on the CsBi-GIC's
were nearly the   same as those  used  for the   KHg-GIC's,  described   in
Section <A HREF="node46.html#khghydexp"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  There  were several differences,   however.  One
was that  the  CsBi  samples were  routinely  cleaved before the   T<SUB>c</SUB>
measurement so that any transition observed would be due to the bulk of the
sample,   and  not  a spurious effect  arising from  alloy  adsorbed on the
surface.   Lagrange and coworkers do not  report whether they cleaved their
samples  or not.  KHg-GIC's very rarely  had any adsorbed alloy since their
intercalation  is accomplished through a  vapor-phase reaction, in contrast
to the contact reaction necessary to intercalate the MBi-GIC's.  Therefore,
KHg samples were not generally cleaved before  T<SUB>c</SUB> measurements.
<P>
	Because   cleaving is  a  difficult   operation to perform   in the
glovebox on small samples, the CsBi-GIC's were cleaved in air.  Handling in
air was also necessary to  perform the weight-uptake measurements described
in  Section <A HREF="node19.html#chemanal"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.   Because  of     the  compounds'  excellent
stability   in air,[<A HREF="node66.html#lagrange87">145</A>] the   brief exposures to  air were not
thought to  influence the superconductivity  experiments.  The  work of the
Nancy group does not state whether their samples were exposed to air before
the low-temperature experiments.
<P>
	The CsBi-GIC's were place in glass ampoules for the low-temperature
experiments. They were not fixed in metal sample-holders as the KHg-GIC's
were [See Section <A HREF="node25.html#mounting"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>], though, because no critical field
measurements were performed on them.  The inductive  T<SUB>c</SUB>  measurements
were performed on the CsBi-GIC's in the same manner as on the KHg-GIC's
[See Section <A HREF="node24.html#critfexp"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>].  The temperature range of the inductive
measurements was from 4.2 K to about 0.4 K, just as for the  KHg
experiments.
<P>
	The air stability of the CsBi compounds allowed resistive  T<SUB>c</SUB>
measurements to  be performed  easily on  them.   Contacts  were  made with
silver paint on  the edges  of the GIC  in a standard  four-probe geometry.
The samples  were then encapsulated in  a cell filled with helium   gas for
good  thermal  contact at  low temperatures.   Both  zero-field temperature
sweeps and fixed-temperature field sweeps  were performed on CsBi <i>alpha</i>-
and <i>alpha</i> + <i>beta</i>-phase samples.  The temperature range of the resistive
measurements  was from liquid  helium temperature (4.2 K)  to  about 1.1 K.
Current densities used were on the order of 10<SUP>-1</SUP>-10<SUP>-2</SUP> A/cm<SUP>2</SUP>.
The results did not depend on the current density employed.  The values of
the normal-state resistivity obtained from the temperature sweeps were
estimated to be uncertain by about 25% due to remanent fields in the
Bitter magnets used for the Shubnikov-de Haas measurements.
