	 As was  discussed in  Section <A HREF="node27.html#procedure"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, one of the possible
extrinsic causes  of the deviations in   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)  is  that the
GIC's    a-axis  may not     have   been  mounted   perfectly   vertically.
Figure <A HREF="node29.html#misalign"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>a) shows  the properly aligned  case for  reference, and
Figure <A HREF="node29.html#misalign"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>b)  illustrates the case  where the  sample  is placed
inside the  inductance bridge with  its c-axis rotated  by an angle  &#248;
from the horizontal.  In both a) and b), the laboratory  vertical is called
^z.  The  sample in-plane axes  are denoted by  ^a  and  ^a<SUP>'</SUP>.  Thus in  a)   ^z and
 ^a<SUP>'</SUP> are parallel, whereas  in  b), the  misaligned case,
the angle between  ^z  and  ^a<SUP>'</SUP> is also &#248;.
Since the   measurements  described here were  done  on HOPG, the  sample's
c-axis is  a well-defined crystallographic  direction, but the crystallites
are randomly oriented  in-plane,  and so the  directions  ^a and
 ^a<SUP>'</SUP> are designated merely for convenience.
<P>
        The important  point to notice  here  is that in b) the  ^a   axis is still in the horizontal plane, even though the c-axis is
not.  Therefore rotation of the sample about  ^z will allow
correct measurement of  H<SUB>c2,|| ^a</SUB> =  H<SUB>c2,_|_ ^c</SUB>, but the value measured for  H<SUB>c2, || ^c</SUB> will
be off be a factor  corresponding to &#248;  degrees.  In fact, the minimum
in the measured  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) will come when  <i>vec</i>H is in the
plane  defined by the vector  ^c and  ^z.  Through use
of Eqn. <A HREF="node28.html#ldtheor"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, one can see that the minimum measured critical field
for the misaligned case will be  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(0&#176;)/<i>sqrt</i><i>cos</i><SUP>2</SUP> &#248; + <i>epsilon</i><SUP>2</SUP> <i>sin</i><SUP>2</SUP> &#248;.  With a  bit more effort, by following the
original derivation  of  Morris,  Coleman, and  Bhandari[<A HREF="node66.html#morris72">175</A>] the
formula for  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)  for a specimen tilted by  an angle &#248;
can be derived:<BR>
<P>
<P><A NAME=tilthc2>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img50.gif"><P>
<P>
 The detailed derivation of this formula is outlined in 
Appendix <A HREF="node64.html#tiltderiv"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  If one  lets  H<SUB>c2,|| ^c</SUB><SUP>eff</SUP> == H<SUB>c2,|| ^c</SUB>/<i>sqrt</i><i>cos</i><SUP>2</SUP>&#248; + <i>epsilon</i><SUP>2</SUP><i>sin</i><SUP>2</SUP>&#248;    and     <i>epsilon</i><SUP>eff</SUP> == <i>epsilon</i>/<i>sqrt</i><i>cos</i><SUP>2</SUP>&#248; + <i>epsilon</i><SUP>2</SUP><i>sin</i><SUP>2</SUP>&#248;, then one recovers the form <A HREF="node28.html#ldtheor"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> only with
the   effective  quantities  replacing  the actual  ones.   The impact of a
non-zero  tilt angle is therefore  to increase the measured  value  of  H<SUB>c2,|| ^c</SUB> but  not  to change  the measured  value of  H<SUB>c2,_|_ ^c</SUB>,    therefore   reducing  the  apparent  anisotropy,
1/<i>epsilon</i>  =  H<SUB>c2,_|_^c</SUB>/H<SUB>c2,|| ^c</SUB>.  Since
the experimental data  in  Figure <A HREF="node28.html#hc2theta"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>b)  is higher than  the fit
near  <i>vec</i>H||^c, sample tilt seems like a good candidate
for   explaining the  discrepancy.   However,    the impact of  tilt for  a
plausible  range of  &#248; is quite  small since   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) is
quite flat near <i>theta</i> = 0.  The minute amount of distortion of the
curves that   occurs for  a believable  tilt    angle  (&#248; <= 5&#176;) is  demonstrated  in  Figure <A HREF="node29.html#tilteffect"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  After examining
this figure one  can conclude that the    effect of specimen tilt  on
 H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) is probably unimportant.

	Besides macroscopic tilt of the specimen, there  is another type of
misalignment that  can  influence the shape   of the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)
curves.  A microscopic type of misalignment is mosaic spread, which in this
context means the  half-width-at-half-maximum-intensity (HWHM) of   a GIC's
(00<i>l</i>) peaks in a diffractometer rocking scan.   The mosaic spread is a
measure of the degree to which the c-axes of the crystallites in a piece of
HOPG are aligned.  Clearly if the planes of a GIC are not flat, the peak in
 H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) will be somewhat  smeared  out.   Therefore, a  finite
amount of mosaic spread will  reduce the anisotropy  ratio by reducing  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(90&#176;) = H<SUB>c2,_|_ ^c</SUB>.   The  effect of mosaic
spread  on the critical fields of  the GIC superconductors was estimated by
convolving the  formula in Equation <A HREF="node28.html#ldtheor"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> with a  gaussian function
to represent the probability of misalignment as  a function of misalignment
angle.  With a  gaussian distribution of  misaligned crystallites, for each
increment <i>Delta</i> away from  perfect alignment, there  is a reduction by a
factor  1/<b>e</b> in probability.  Therefore   only orientations  within  about
<i>Delta</i> degrees of perfect alignment contribute significantly. The form of
the expression is:<BR>
<P>
<P><A NAME=mostheta>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img53.gif"><P>
<P>
 where <i>theta</i> is the angle for which the critical field is being
calculated,    <i>theta</i><SUB>i</SUB> is  the    dummy  variable (which runs  from
0&#176; to 180&#176;), and <i>Delta</i> is the mosaic spread in degrees.
The  results of the   calculations    are exemplified by   the  curves   in
Figure <A HREF="node29.html#mospread"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.

	The most  appropriate HWHM  of the gaussian   would be the   mosaic
spread measured by (00<i>l</i>) diffraction,  if known.   In the present work
the mosaic spread was unknown, and so <i>Delta</i>  was used  as a parameter in
the fits.  Because a non-zero mosaic  spread makes the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)
curves  broader,  it actually  worsened agreement  between   experiment and
theory, since the theoretical curves are already too broad in the  wings of
the peak.  This finding  does not, of course, indicate  that the GIC's used
in these experiments were perfect crystals; rather it is an indication that
the real cause of the unsatisfactory fits for the  T<SUB>c</SUB> = 1.5 K samples
has not yet been identified.
<P>
        The presence  of multiple crystalline  or disordered phases in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg is another property that  could impact upon  the angular dependence
curves.  The differing properties of the two phases are discussed in detail
in Chapter <A HREF="node40.html#hydrog"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  As far as the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) curves go, it
suffices to say that since the phases may have different  T<SUB>c</SUB>'s, they could
have different upper critical fields.   If these two phases are distributed
inhomogenenously in the GIC's, then at  the lowest temperatures, where both
of  them    are  superconducting,     their  presence could   distort   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>).   However,  the temperature and   sample dependence of the
quality  of the  fits weigh against  this interpretation.   For  one thing,
Figure <A HREF="node28.html#hc2theta"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>b) shows that the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) curves are quite
reproducible  from sample to  sample,   an  unlikely  occurrence   if   the
distribution of phases is important.  Secondly, as mentioned  in connection
with Figure <A HREF="node30.html#thetatemp"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, the quality of the fits improves with decreasing
temperature, the opposite of  what would be  expected if a  lower- T<SUB>c</SUB>
minority phase  were causing  the  deviations.  Thirdly, the  samples which
show  larger  deviations from   the   AGL  functional   form have  narrower
zero-field   transitions   than the lower- T<SUB>c</SUB>   specimens  which  are
well-fit by Eqn. <A HREF="node28.html#ldtheor"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  X-ray  and neutron diffraction experiments
confirm that  the higher- T<SUB>c</SUB> samples are  actually more  uniform   than the
lower- T<SUB>c</SUB> ones.
<P>
	The last of the extrinsic factors that needs to  be considered as a
explanation of  the disagreement between the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) data and
fits to the data  is the  possibility  of bias influenced  by the method of
data reduction.  As was discussed  in Section <A HREF="node27.html#procedure"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, the standard
working  definition of   H<SUB>c2</SUB> (for  inductive transitions) was used;
this procedure gives  H<SUB>c2</SUB> as the intersection of a tangent drawn to
the most linear part of the field sweep with the level upper portion of the
trace.  The unavoidable question when encountering difficulties  in fitting
 H<SUB>c2</SUB> data is whether there is any reason  to expect agreement given
that the  theoretical definition  of  H<SUB>c2</SUB> is  so different from the
working one.  That is, there  is  no guarantee that the  field found by the
procedure described above  corresponds to the  highest field where vortices
can nucleate in the superconductor, which is  the theoretical definition of
 H<SUB>c2</SUB>.[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham80">252</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#helfand66">108</A>]  The possibility  of  bias  due to
analysis is particularly  troublesome   for  the study of  H<SUB>c2</SUB>  in
anisotropic  superconductors,  where the  transition shape can  be a strong
function of <i>theta</i>, as Figure <A HREF="node27.html#hc2def"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>b) shows.
<P>
	The  only   response  that  an  experimentalist  can  make to  such
criticism is that the procedure defined above is as  good as any available,
and   that   it is   capable   of  producing data which    are  well-fit by
Equation <A HREF="node28.html#ldtheor"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, as Figure <A HREF="node28.html#hc2theta"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>a) shows. In order to check
for   any bias  introduced  by    the  tangent method    of critical  field
determination used here, the alternative definition of   H<SUB>c2</SUB> as the
90% completion point  of the transition was  also tried  in analyzing some
 H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)  data   sets.  Figure <A HREF="node29.html#ninetytangent"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>    is  a
comparison  of   the curves obtained    using the  two  different  analysis
techniques.  As  this juxtaposition  shows,  slightly different  curves are
produced by   the   two  analysis methods.   However,   the agreement  with
Eqn. <A HREF="node28.html#ldtheor"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> is not  improved.   Therefore  it  is  thought that  the
unsatisfactory quality of the fits to the  T<SUB>c</SUB> = 1.5 K samples  is not
an artifact of the analysis.  In  a similar vein,  Decroux and Fischer have
noted  that  H<SUB>c2</SUB> results on  the  molybdenum chalcogenide compounds
(also called Chevrel phases) are not biased by the critical field definition
as long as the compounds do not contain magnetic ions.[<A HREF="node66.html#decroux82">53</A>]
