        Sample preparation and characterization is quite an important
topic for the ternary graphite-based superconductors.  A thorough
discussion of specimen synthesis and handling is obligatory not only
because it is customary, but because the details of these techniques
appear to impact the results of the experiments discussed in the
following chapters in non-trivial ways.  Reports in the literature on
superconducting GIC's have often been confusing or even contradictory
for reasons possibly related to differences between the samples
prepared by the various research groups.  Because of the inadequate
information about sample preparation in many papers (as in, ``The
samples were prepared using the technique of Ref. X ...''), one is
often left wondering whether in-house experiments and those by other
groups were performed on comparable materials.  It is the aim of this
chapter to give enough information about the samples used in the
current experiments so that anyone who reproduces these efforts will
not have to ask a similar question.  <P>

        The leaders in the field of ternary GIC discovery and
synthesis are the group at the University of Nancy.  Under the
leadership of Profs.  H&#233;rold and Lagrange, a team of students and
staff has synthesized an impressive array of ternary GIC
superconductors.  The first reported were the MHg-GIC's, where M
stands for one the heavy alkali metals.[<A
HREF="node66.html#lagrange80">150</A>] Soon after the same authors
described the preparation of the MTl-GIC's,[<A
HREF="node66.html#lagrange80">150</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#elmakrini80a">73</A>] and recently they announced
the discovery of the large class of MBi-GIC's.[<A
HREF="node66.html#lagrange85">146</A>] All of these materials have
been reported to be superconducting.  Lagrange[<A
HREF="node66.html#lagrange87">145</A>] has recently reviewed the
lessons learned about the intercalation chemistry of this entire class
of compounds.  <P>

        It should be noted that the Nancy group has also synthesized
ternary GIC's whose superconductivity seems probable, but has not been
experimentally verified.  Besides the alkali-metal/heavy-metal
ternaries mentioned above, whose intercalant sandwich consists of
multiple metal layers, there are also ternaries with monolayer
intercalant sandwiches.  Among these candidates are solid solutions of
known GIC superconductors, such
C<SUB>8</SUB>K<SUB>1-x</SUB>Rb<SUB>x</SUB>,[<A
HREF="node66.html#billaud74">24</A>] and others such as sodium-barium
GIC's[<A HREF="node66.html#billaud74a">25</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#billaud78">26</A>] whose superconductivity seems
quite likely in terms of existing models.[<A
HREF="node66.html#M143">4</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#fischer85">86</A>]
These materials have received a lot of attention from a structural
characterization standpoint,[<A HREF="node66.html#chow83">39</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#chow87a">40</A>] but few cryogenic transport studies
have been performed on them.  The reader will find more information on
these compounds in a recent review by Solin and Zabel.[<A
HREF="node66.html#solin88">218</A>] There is also a whole new class of
alkali-metal/antimony compounds whose low-temperature[<A
HREF="node66.html#essaddek88">83</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#elmakrini88">71</A>] properties are unknown.
Despite the fundamental interest in these materials, they will not be
discussed further here, since determination of their superconductivity
is left for future investigators.  <P>

        The superconductivity of the alkali-metal/heavy-metal ternary
GIC's is the focus of the remainder of this work.  Sample preparation
issues are particularly important for superconductivity experiments
because they presumably are the key to understanding why such a wide
range of transition temperatures has been reported for some
superconducting GIC's.  For example, T<SUB>c</SUB> for
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg has been variously reported in the range from 0.7[<A
HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>] to 1.6 K,[<A
HREF="node66.html#N128">247</A>] while T<SUB>c</SUB> for
C<SUB>4</SUB>CsBi<SUB>0.5</SUB> has been quoted from 4.05 K[<A
HREF="node66.html#lagrange85">146</A>] to <=0.5 K.[<A
HREF="node66.html#E291">36</A>] In the next few sections an attempt
will be made to relate sample preparation conditions to
reproducibility problems with superconductivity experiments in GIC's.
