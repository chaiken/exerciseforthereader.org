	The three factors  described   above, namely sample  tilt,   mosaic
spread, and critical field  definition, are  the extrinsic influences which
may affect the shape of  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>).  None of these is  thought to
have a  large  effect  on  the  data.  There  are   also  more fundamental,
intrinsic explanations for  the disparity between data  and fit.   Probably
the most applicable of these to  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg   is the conceivable existence
of   type  I superconductivity  for  field   orientations near   <i>theta</i> =
0&#176;.   Type  I superconductivity  for  0&#176; <= <i>theta</i> <= 25&#176; has been previously reported for  C<SUB>8</SUB>K by
several         groups[<A HREF="node66.html#kobayashi81a">137</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#kobayashi81">136</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#koike80">141</A>].          C<SUB>9.4</SUB>K[<A HREF="node66.html#kobayashi81a">137</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#kobayashi81">136</A>] and  C<SUB>8</SUB>Rb[<A HREF="node66.html#kobayashi85">133</A>],
on the other hand, are found to be type I for  all field  directions.   The
existence  of  type  I   character for   a    range of  angles   in layered
superconductors  was predicted even   before  its experimental discovery by
Kats.[<A HREF="node66.html#kats69">127</A>]  For   these    reasons    the  question   of    type  I
superconductivity in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg should be approached with  an open mind,
despite  the type II  superconductivity reported for all field orientations
in Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>].

	Iye and Tanuma concluded that  there is no type I superconductivity
in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg because  they did  not observe supercooling in their field
sweeps   for any   angle   <i>theta</i>.[<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>] However,  the presence  of
supercooling  and the differential  paramagnetic effect  (DPE) are  not the
only criteria for  the  determination of  the  type  of  superconductivity.
Another approach to the question is to look at the Ginzburg-Landau <i>kappa</i>
parameter since <i>kappa</i> = 1/<i>sqrt</i>2 is the critical value dividing type
I  and type II superconductors.    <i>kappa</i> can be estimated using  specific
heat    and    critical    field   data through    use   of   the following
formulae:[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham80">252</A>]<BR>
<P>
<P><A NAME=kappadef>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img57.gif"><P>
<P>
 where <i>Lambda</i> is the magnetic field penetration depth, <i>xi</i> is the
coherence length,   H<SUB>c</SUB>(0)  is  the zero-temperature  thermodynamic
critical field, and <i>Gamma</i> is the normal-state linear electronic specific
heat coefficient.  The equality between <i>kappa</i> and <i>kappa</i><SUB>1</SUB>  is good to
within about 20%,[<A HREF="node66.html#eilenberger67">69</A>] so we can use <i>kappa</i><SUB>1</SUB>  as a rough
esimate of <i>kappa</i>.   (In the discussion below,  what  is  referred  to as
<i>kappa</i> has actually been calculated using the definition  of <i>kappa</i><SUB>1</SUB>.)
Because <i>Gamma</i> has been  measured for  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg,[<A HREF="node66.html#alexander81">8</A>] one
can estimate    <i>kappa</i>(0)  by calculating    H<SUB>c</SUB>(0)  and linearly
extrapolating   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) to  zero temperature.  The  applicability of
this procedure to the   T<SUB>c</SUB> =  1.5  K GIC's is  uncertain  because  no
superconducting  transition was observed down  to 0.8  K in  the samples on
which <i>Gamma</i> was measured.   It  seems possible  that <i>Gamma</i> could   be
different in  the  T<SUB>c</SUB> = 1.5  K and  T<SUB>c</SUB> = 0.7  K  samples, even
though it is a property of the normal state.   Also,  <i>Gamma</i> was given in
Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#alexander81">8</A>] in molar units, so in order to convert to cgs units
one must calculate  the molar volume,  which  means that one  must assume a
structure for the compound.  Here a (2 &#215; 2)R0&#176; in-plane unit
cell is  employed, since this  is the structure  which has  most frequently
been   observed     in     C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.[<A HREF="node66.html#kamitakahara84">123</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#K167">246</A>]   (See
Figure <A HREF="node6.html#c8kstruct"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.)  Despite these caveats, since no other measurement
of the specific heat is available, it is useful to see what can  be learned
by estimating  <i>kappa</i>.    The results of this   calculation  are given in
Table <A HREF="node30.html#kappatable"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> for three  MIT  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg  samples and three  from
Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>].    Notice that the  magnitude of   <i>kappa</i> is generally
lower for the higher- T<SUB>c</SUB>  specimens.  The  implication is that type I
transitions are more likely to be observed in the higher- T<SUB>c</SUB> GIC's.

<BR><STRONG>Table:</STRONG> Calculated values of  <i>kappa</i> for selected  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg samples.
The   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(0)  numbers come  from  linear extrapolation  of the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) data (see Section <A HREF="node34.html#hvstdata"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>), and so are independent of the
 H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) measurements.<BR>
<P>
<P>
	The meaning of <i>kappa</i> will be discussed in more detail below, but
for the moment it suffices to say that  <i>kappa</i><SUB>|| ^c</SUB> tend
to  be  quite close to    <i>kappa</i><SUB>critical</SUB>  =   0.707.   The primary
conclusion from  this calculation  is  that within  the  uncertainty of the
approximations made, the  type of the  superconductivity in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg is
indeterminate, but that it could  very well be type I  for some samples for
<i>theta</i>  close to zero.  This  is   especially true at higher temperatures
since, according to the two-fluid model:[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham80">252</A>]
<P>
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img59.gif"><P>
<P>
 where <b>t</b> is the reduced temperature.  Thus it seems
quite likely that the presence of  type I superconductivity  is a factor in
explaining  the poor  fits obtained  to     H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) data  with
Equation <A HREF="node28.html#ldtheor"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, at least in some specimens at higher temperatures.
<P>
	Since   <i>kappa</i><SUB>|| ^c</SUB>  decreases  with increasing
temperature, the  angular range in  which  type I  behavior   occurs should
increase as  t increases.   The variation of  the  angular range of  type I
character  is  observed in  TaN, the only  non-GIC  bulk material  known to
display  type   I   or   type    II      character depending    on    field
orientation.[<A HREF="node66.html#weber78">259</A>]  Some   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)    at    constant
temperature  curves for  TaN are shown  in Figure <A HREF="node30.html#TaN"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  In the bottom
trace, at T  = 1.65 K, TaN is  type II  for  all  angles, as  the excellent
agreement with the dashed fit indicates.  When the temperature is increased
to 1.8 K, the sample  has type I character near  the  [100] direction, with
the result  that the  data there deviate above  the dashed curve.  When the
temperature increase to 2.1  K, the measured critical  field for almost all
angles <i>theta</i> is  H<SUB>c</SUB>, and when the temperature reaches 2.4 K, the
sample is type I for all orientations.   C<SUB>8</SUB>K might also be type I for
all orientations for  temperatures sufficiently close  to  T<SUB>c</SUB>.    The
change with temperature of the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)  fits for  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg
is qualitatively similar,  although less  dramatic, since  type II behavior
persists for a much larger range of angles.  For the  higher- T<SUB>c</SUB>  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg specimens,   the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)  curves   are  probably most
comparable to the 1.8 K TaN trace in Figure <A HREF="node30.html#TaN"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.

	If type I superconductivity is indeed present in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg, this
fact should be accounted for in fitting the  data.  In Figure <A HREF="node30.html#hctemp"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>,
new fits are shown in which the theoretical curve has the form:<BR>
<P>
<P><A NAME=typeItheta>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img62.gif"><P>
<P>
 The idea behind using this functional form is that if  H<SUB>c</SUB> is greater
than   H<SUB>c2</SUB>,  then  H<SUB>c</SUB>   will  presumably be measured  as the
critical field.  A quick comparison of Figs. <A HREF="node30.html#thetatemp"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> and
<A HREF="node30.html#hctemp"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> shows that  inclusion of  H<SUB>c</SUB>  as a parameter dramatically
improves the  quality  of   the fits   at  all  temperatures.    This large
improvement is in contrast to the small (or  negative) impact on the quality of
fit of the mosaic spread and tilt parameters.  Residuals  for the fits with
and without type  I behavior are gathered  in   Table <A HREF="node32.html#residsum"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.   The
improvement in the  residual index  is  not  accounted  for  simply by  the
addition of another free parameter since the number of  parameters is taken
into account in the definition of <i>cal</i> R (see Eqn. <A HREF="node28.html#residef"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>).

	For these new fits,  H<SUB>c</SUB> was taken  as a free  parameter.  The
numbers  obtained for  the  thermodynamic critical   field from   the   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) fits for two samples are shown in Table <A HREF="node30.html#htherm_table"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>,
and  H<SUB>c</SUB>(T) is plotted in Figure <A HREF="node30.html#hcfig"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.   According to the BCS
theory,  H<SUB>c</SUB>(T) should be  quadratic, having the form  (1 - t<SUP>2</SUP>).   The fact that  the  H<SUB>c</SUB>  values  found from  the angular
dependence are better fit by a straight line  is somewhat disturbing, since
 (1 - t)  behavior  is  expected  for   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) (see
Section <A HREF="node34.html#hvstdata"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>).  However,  H<SUB>c</SUB>(T) showed  <em> positive
curvature</em> in   C<SUB>8</SUB>K (see Figure <A HREF="node39.html#c6k"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>), where  signs of  type I
superconductivity (large hysteresis  and differential  paramagnetic effect)
were unmistakable.[<A HREF="node66.html#koike80">141</A>] Since the  temperature dependence of   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) is   unusual in   C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg, perhaps  it  is    not straining
credibility too much  to suggest that   H<SUB>c</SUB>(T)  could be  anomalous,
too, just as in  C<SUB>8</SUB>K.
<P>
The obvious question  is whether  these
values of the critical field are consistent with those  calculated from the
specific  heat  measurements, also  given  in  the  table.  The  calculated
thermodynamic critical field tends to be about 1.8 times  the fit one.  The
most  likely  explanation for this   inconsistency   is that the  value  of
<i>Gamma</i> quoted in Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#alexander81">8</A>]  is  simply too high.   For  the
reasons mentioned above, a  higher value   of  <i>Gamma</i> for  the  sample of
Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#alexander81">8</A>] would not be very surprising.
<P>
        Another  possible  explanation for the difference  in  magnitude of
 H<SUB>c</SUB> is that up to this point the demagnetization  factor <i>cal</i> D has
not been taken into account.   (1 - <i>cal</i> D) H<SUB>c</SUB> is the field
where normal regions  are first  formed.[<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham80">252</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#livingston69">157</A>] Thus,
the ideal type  of   magnetization curve shown in  Figure <A HREF="node23.html#figmeiss"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>a is
found only for ideal samples with <i>cal</i> D = 0; in real specimens the sharp
corner is  rounded.  The number,  size, and   shape of  the  normal regions
formed for   (1 - <i>cal</i> D) H<SUB>c</SUB> ;SPM<SUB>l</SUB>t; H<SUB>applied</SUB> ;SPM<SUB>l</SUB>t; H<SUB>c</SUB> depends
typically on sample size, shape, defects,  and  orientation with respect to
the applied  field.[<A HREF="node66.html#livingston69">157</A>]   The primary effect  of  a non-zero
demagnetization factor then is to change the  shape of the  transition with
angle.  Because of  the method of   critical field determination used  here
(see Figure <A HREF="node27.html#hc2def"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>b), the possible influence  of demagnetization on the
transition      shape  cannot  be    completely  ruled    out.   Therefore,
demagnetization-induced distortion  could be  causing the measured critical
field to be substantially less than  the actual value of   H<SUB>c</SUB>.   The
influence of demagnetization effects should be  particularly strong for the
conditions used in the study of   C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg, since for  thin plates in a
transverse field (here  <i>vec</i>H || ^c)  <i>cal</i> D   
1.0, meaning  that the samples  are effectively  always in the intermediate
state.[<A HREF="node66.html#livingston69">157</A>]

        Ideally  it would be  possible to obtain the demagnetization factor
as a  function of angle  in order  to correct the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) and
 H<SUB>c</SUB>(T) curves.  Past experimentalists have gotten a value for <i>cal</i> D by machining a material with known critical fields to the size and shape
of the  sample.[<A HREF="node66.html#denhoff82">59</A>] Then  one gets  <i>cal</i> D by comparing  the
measured critical fields of the machined specimen to  the known  values for
shapes with zero demagnetization.  Unfortunately this  procedure would have
to be carried out for each specimen.  If a reliable calculation of <i>cal</i> D
were available, it would also allow a more  rigorous testing of the theory.
However,  since the demagnetization  is strongly  dependent  on the  sample
dimensions[<A HREF="node66.html#denhoff82">59</A>] and because <i>cal</i> D could easily be affected by
such hard-to-quantify factors as exfoliation, the amount of effort required
does not seem worthwhile.  Any use of a value for the demagnetization would
also require the introduction of several new parameters.
<P>
	An ideal type I superconductor should be easy to distinguish from a
type II superconductor because of the discontinuity in its magnetization at
 <=ft| <i>vec</i>H <i>|</i> = H<SUB>c</SUB>.   (See Figure <A HREF="node23.html#figmeiss"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>).
However, a non-zero demagnetization  factor can smear out the magnetization
curve,  making even type   I  transitions appear more  or  less continuous.
Despite the presence  of  demagnetization  effects,  it seems  sensible  to
examine the field sweeps to  see if there is any  evidence of discontinuity
under the conditions where type I behavior is suspected.
<P>
	  In  the    lower- T<SUB>c</SUB> C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg    samples  (whose   H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)    curves   were  well-fit  by    Eqn. <A HREF="node28.html#ldtheor"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>),  the
experimental traces appear smooth for all angles, as Figure <A HREF="node30.html#transhape"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>a)
shows.  The  only major  difference  between <i>theta</i> = 90&#176; and
<i>theta</i> = 0&#176; is that the high-angle transitions are considerably
broader, for reasons discussed in  Section <A HREF="node24.html#critfexp"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  This result is
consistent with  the  finding  that these  samples  were type  II  for  all
orientations, and is consistent with Iye and Tanuma's findings.[<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>]
<P>
	In  the  T<SUB>c</SUB>   = 1.5 K   samples, the  field  sweeps for   <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c look smooth, just as they do for the lower- T<SUB>c</SUB> 
GIC's.  For  <i>vec</i>H || ^c, on the other  hand, the curves
appear fairly continuous  on the upsweep,  but develop   a corner near  the
upper critical  field  on the downsweep  which   could be  identified  as a
discontinuity.  The arrow  in Figure <A HREF="node30.html#transhape"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>b) indicates the location
of the  corner.   While it  is  tempting   to identify  this   corner  as a
discontinuity stemming from a first-order transition, it  is a fairly small
feature.  Therefore, the evidence regarding type I versus type  II behavior
from the   field  sweeps  is  suggestive  but  ambiguous.   Low-temperature
magnetization measurements would  probably  be  easier to   interpret  than
susceptibility in  this  regard,   but unfortunately there was    no readily
available magnetometer that could be cooled to  the necessary   1 K
range.

        Why   should  the lower- T<SUB>c</SUB>  specimens   be  type  II for all
orientations,   and  the  higher- T<SUB>c</SUB> ones    be   type   I  for some
orientations?   The   superficial answer  is  that   H<SUB>c2</SUB>  isn't  as
strongly    T<SUB>c</SUB>-dependent as might  be  expected, since  the  critical
fields of the  T<SUB>c</SUB> = 1.5 K samples are only slightly higher than those
of the  T<SUB>c</SUB> = 0.7 K samples.  (Refer to Table <A HREF="node30.html#kappatable"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> for the
relevant numbers.)  If  H<SUB>c</SUB> increases as  T<SUB>c</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>  and  H<SUB>c2</SUB>
increases only weakly with  T<SUB>c</SUB>, the net result  must be a decrease in
<i>kappa</i> with increasing   T<SUB>c</SUB>.  The  deeper answer to the question is
that <i>xi</i> and <i>Lambda</i>, the lengths whose ratio determines  <i>kappa</i>, are
both affected by changes in v<SUB>F</SUB> and  <i>l</i>,  the  Fermi velocity and the
mean-free-path.[<A HREF="node66.html#orlando79">186</A>]   Therefore,   one  can invoke  differences
between the two sample types either in the Fermi  surface or in crystalline
perfection to  explain dissimilarity   of their   critical fields.   Of
course,  the same  mechanism should  ideally  also explain  their different
zero-field   transition  temperatures.  Since   the  lower- T<SUB>c</SUB>   gold
specimens  have  broader zero-field superconducting  transitions   than the
higher- T<SUB>c</SUB> pink samples (see Table <A HREF="node20.html#tcfreq"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>), it seems natural to
think that the gold samples are  less well-ordered.  This line of reasoning
implies  that the   gold   specimens  have  a  lower  mean-free-path.   The
differences between the gold and  pink samples are  discussed  at length in
Chapter <A HREF="node40.html#hydrog"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  In the meantime, the implications of possible type I
superconductivity in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg deserve further consideration.
<P>
        Another good question about the  H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) curves is why
the  data are not perfectly flat  near  <i>theta</i> = 0 if the measured
critical field is  H<SUB>c</SUB> there.  Some angular  dependence of  H<SUB>c</SUB>
is also present  in  the   TaN  data of Figure <A HREF="node30.html#TaN"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.    As  was  first
suggested by   P.  Tedrow[<A HREF="node66.html#tedrow88">242</A>], the  angular  dependence  of  the
demagnetization factor could influence the shape of the field sweeps enough
to  cause a perceived   angular dependence  of   H<SUB>c</SUB>.   	Koike <em> et
al.</em>[<A HREF="node66.html#koike80">141</A>] in their   study of  C<SUB>8</SUB>K  also noticed  a  small
angular  dependence   of     H<SUB>c</SUB>     near     <i>theta</i> =    0    (see
Figure <A HREF="node30.html#Khc2theta"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>).  In addition,      they  measured   a     strongly
angle-dependent supercooling field which they thought must be  H<SUB>c3</SUB>,
the  surface nucleation  field.     However,  H<SUB>c3</SUB> is not
angle-dependent in the sense indicated in Figure <A HREF="node30.html#Khc2theta"><IMG WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>; it is
in fact equal to 1.69 H<SUB>c2</SUB>(theta), but here <i>theta</i> is the angle
between the crystal surface and the c-axis, not the angle between the
applied field and the c-axis.[<A HREF="node66.html#orlando88">187</A>]  Thus  H<SUB>c3</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)
can only be measured by preparing different crystals with differently
oriented surfaces, not by turning the applied magnetic field.
<P>
        There   is   another   problem  with   the   identification  of the
angle-dependent supercoooling field with  H<SUB>c3</SUB>.  The problem is that
 H<SUB>c3</SUB>  is the surface  nucleation  field for a field   applied  <em>
parallel</em> to the surface,[<A HREF="node66.html#degennes66">54</A>],  while  <i>vec</i>H || ^c corresponds to the field <em> perpendicular</em> to the  surface.  In
some anisotropic   Chevrel phases with  an   unusual grain structure,   H<SUB>c3</SUB> has been  seen for the   ``wrong'' orientation, but  for HOPG-based
GIC's   such  as   the ones  studied by   Koike   and coworkers,  no   such
microstructural   anomalies  are   anticipated.[<A HREF="node66.html#orlando88">187</A>] Therefore  the
identification of the supercooling field  || ^c with  H<SUB>c3</SUB> must be  mistaken.   It seems  likely that  the
angular    dependence     of    the   supercooling     field  reported   in
Ref. [<A HREF="node66.html#koike80">141</A>] is  a demagnetization-derived  effect, along   with the
slight angular dependence of  H<SUB>c</SUB> observed in  C<SUB>8</SUB>K[<A HREF="node66.html#koike80">141</A>]
and  C<SUB>8</SUB>Rb[<A HREF="node66.html#kobayashi85a">134</A>].    Certainly  the    change   in  the
demagnetization <i>cal</i> D (from 1 for   vecH perpendicular to a plate
to 0 for  <i>vec</i>H parallel  to a plate) is large  enough to cause this
apparent angular dependence.[<A HREF="node66.html#tedrow88">242</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#tinkham80">252</A>]
