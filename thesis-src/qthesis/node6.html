<A NAME=intro>&#160;</A>

Anisotropic superconductivity is the fastest-growing condensed-matter
physics subfield of the late 1980's.  The primary boom has been in the
high-temperature superconductivity industry, which was created
seemingly overnight by Bednorz and M&#252;ller's astonishing discovery
of over-30 K superconductivity in
La<SUB>5-x</SUB>Ba<SUB>x</SUB>Cu<SUB>5</SUB>O<SUB>y</SUB>.[<A
HREF="node66.html#muller87">178</A>] The subsequent observation of 90
K superconductivity in YBa<SUB>2</SUB>Cu<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>7</SUB>[<A
HREF="node66.html#wu87">269</A>] changed the character of
superconductivity research forever.  <P>

        Even before the attention of the physics community was
focussed on the new high- T<SUB>c</SUB> materials, the field of
superconductivity was far from dormant.  There were contributions from
superconductivity research to many different disciplines, such as the
influence of granular superconductivity research on percolation
theory,[<A HREF="node66.html#orr87">191</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#lobb87">158</A>] or the influence of the study of
Josephson-junction arrays on the theory of two-dimensional phase
transitions.[<A HREF="node66.html#nelson79">182</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#forrester88">88</A>] Despite the many aspects of
superconductivity research in the '80's, though, one paradigm has been
central throughout: the concept of anisotropic superconductivity.
This theme has been manifested in all sorts of systems, from
quasi-one-dimensional superconductors like the polymer
SN<SUB>x</SUB>,[<A HREF="node66.html#greene84">95</A>] to
heavy-fermion superconductors with possibly anisotropic
pair-states,[<A HREF="node66.html#stewart84">225</A>] to artificially
layered superconducting superlattices which show a 3D-2D crossover in
their critical fields.[<A HREF="node66.html#ruggiero85">209</A>] The
unexpected advent of high- T<SUB>c</SUB> materials is in harmony with
the theme of anisotropic superconductivity since the oxide
superconductors show orientation-dependent properties in many ways
similar to those of the superconductors studied earlier in the
decade.[<A HREF="node66.html#orlando87">188</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#worthington87">268</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#iye87a">118</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#moodera88">173</A>] <P>

        The principal topic of this thesis is anisotropic
superconductivity of graphite intercalation compounds (GIC's).
Graphite intercalation compounds are superlattices formed by the
chemical insertion into the graphite matrix of a species called the
intercalant.[<A HREF="node66.html#I94">67</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#whittingham82">1</A>] GIC's are called donor
compounds if the intercalant gives electrons to the carbon layers, and
acceptor compounds if the intercalant takes electrons from the carbon
layers.  None of the acceptor GIC's is known to be superconducting,
despite the fact that many of them are metallic.[<A
HREF="node66.html#I94">67</A>,<A HREF="node66.html#ericescy">64</A>]
<P>

        Superconducting GIC's do not have an exotic electron-pairing
mechanism, do not show a 3D-2D crossover, and have no foreseeable
technological applications.  Yet there are many interesting questions
about graphite-based superconductors which remain to be answered,
especially with regard to their anisotropy.  The most obvious of these
questions concerns the very existence of superconductivity in the GIC
C<SUB>8</SUB>K,[<A HREF="node66.html#hannay65">102</A>] a compound
made from two constituents which are not separately superconducting.
C<SUB>8</SUB>K is a binary GIC formed by the insertion of potassium
atoms between the layers of graphite.  The accepted structure of
C<SUB>8</SUB>K is shown in Figure 1.<p>

constant along the direction perpendicular to the planes is called
I<SUB>c</SUB> in GIC's.  b) Three common in-plane structures.

<P>
<P>

        The superconductivity of C<SUB>8</SUB>K is still under
investigation,[<A HREF="node66.html#aljishi88">5</A>] but in recent
years attention has turned more to the ternary GIC superconductors,
which have two intercalated components, an alkali metal (denoted M)
and a heavy metal.  The ternary GIC superconductors are highly
anisotropic, with critical fields that vary by as much as a factor of
47 as a function of orientation.[<A HREF="node66.html#iye83a">121</A>]
The binary GIC superconductors, on the other hand, have critical field
anisotropies only on the order of 4.[<A
HREF="node66.html#koike80">141</A>] Despite an extensive study of the
critical fields of the ternary GIC superconductors by Iye and
Tanuma,[<A HREF="node66.html#iye82">120</A>] there are still some
fundamental questions about the angular and temperature dependence of
the critical fields to be answered.  <P>

        Unlike the binary GIC superconductors, the MHg-GIC's are
synthesized from an intercalant, the MHg amalgam, which is in itself
superconducting.  The intercalation compounds formed from the MHg
amalgams have higher superconducting transition temperatures than the
amalgams themselves.  In addition, the second-stage MHg-GIC's, which
have two carbon layers between the graphite planes, have higher
T<SUB>c</SUB>'s than the stage 1 GIC's, with one carbon layer between
the graphite planes.  These facts run counter to usual expectations
based on proximity-effect theories,[<A
HREF="node66.html#werthamer63">261</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#cooper61">49</A>] which predict the monotonic
depression of T<SUB>c</SUB> when a superconducting material is layered
with a non-superconducting one like graphite.  Therefore the ternary
graphite-based superconductors display qualitatively different
phenomena than the artificially structured superlattices, which do
show behavior qualitatively in agreement with proximity theories.[<A
HREF="node66.html#ruggiero85">209</A>] <P>

        The ternary GIC superconductors are in many respects similar
to the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC's) and their
intercalation compounds (TMDCIC's).  The TMDC's are different from
graphite in that they are by themselves superconducting, but alike in
their divergence from the predictions of proximity-effect theories.
Intercalation of the TMDC's with organic molecules increases their
transition temperature T<SUB>c</SUB>,[<A
HREF="node66.html#gamble70">92</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#prober80">200</A>] despite the fact that the
proximity effect should cause the opposite behavior.  In
graphite-based superconductors, the
 T<SUB>c</SUB> of the intercalant is enhanced by intercalation,
whereas in the TMDC-based superconductors, the T<SUB>c</SUB> of the
host is enhanced by intercalation.  <P>

        The enhancement of T<SUB>c</SUB> in the TMDCIC's that is
associated with intercalation is attributed to the suppression of a
charge-density wave (CDW) state.[<A
HREF="node66.html#murphy75">179</A>] Besides suppression through
intercalation, CDW's in TMDC's can also be inhibited by hydrogen
absorption[<A HREF="node66.html#murphy75">179</A>] and the application
of small hydrostatic pressures.[<A
HREF="node66.html#monceau77">172</A>] Both hydrogen sorption and
hydrostatic pressure in suppressing the CDW raise T<SUB>c</SUB> in the
TMDC's.  Application of a small pressure can also raise T<SUB>c</SUB>
in the ternary GIC superconductor C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.[<A
HREF="node66.html#delong83">55</A>] Recent experiments have also shown
that hydrogen sorption increases the transition temperature of
C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.[<A HREF="node66.html#H242">207</A>] These
experiments in combination with other similarities between the TMDC's
and GIC's suggest the possibility of a CDW in C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg.[<A
HREF="node66.html#delong83">55</A>] <P>

        The fundamental questions in the field of GIC
superconductivity are therefore the following: Why is C<SUB>8</SUB>K
superconducting?  Why do the MHg-GIC's have higher T<SUB>c</SUB>'s
than their intercalants alone?  Why do stage 2 MHg-GIC's have higher
T<SUB>c</SUB>'s than the stage 1?  How can one account for the unusual
angular and temperature dependence of the critical fields in GIC
superconductors?  and Why do hydrogenation and pressure dramatically
increase the T<SUB>c</SUB> of C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg?  Why aren't acceptor
GIC's superconducting?  <P>

        These questions will be addressed in the chapters that follow.
Chapter 2 is a discussion of non-GIC anisotropic superconductors and
the ideas they give regarding the GIC experiments.  Chapter 3 explains
how the samples used in the new experiments were prepared, and
discusses issues in GIC synthesis as they relate to superconductivity.
Chapter 4, the heart of this work, is a report of detailed critical
field studies on C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg, and an account of what these
studies reveal about GIC superconductivity.  Hydrogenation experiments
on C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg and the possibility of a CDW suppression of
T<SUB>c</SUB> are discussed in Chapter 5.  Chapter 6 details attempts
to find superconductivity in CsBi-GIC's, and Chapter 7 is a summary.
<P>

<P> <b> A Word about Notation:</b> In the GIC literature, it is
customary to measure all orientation angles from the graphite c-axis.
On the other hand, in the anisotropic superconductivity literature it
is customary to measure all angles from the layer planes.  The GIC
convention has been adopted here, and all formulae taken from papers
that used the other convention have been converted.  Thus the
direction called || in the superconductivity literature is now called
_|_ c, and the direction called _|_ in the superconductivity
literature is now called || c.  While on the subject of confusion, it
is worth mentioning that cgs units have been used throughout, the
quantity N(0) is the density-of-states for both spin directions, and
<b>e</b> is the electronic charge, a positive quantity.  <P>
