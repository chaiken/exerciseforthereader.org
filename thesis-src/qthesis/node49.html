<P>
        The  hydrogen-induced  T<SUB>c</SUB>  enhancement that   occurs  in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg is a  dramatic, reproducible  phenomenon.  Hydrogenation data looks
much like that from  experiments with applied pressure,  so it  is believed
that  these effects  have  a  common    origin.  The charge-density    wave
explanation of the difference between the pink  and gold samples also seems
consistent   with  the   hydrogenation and  pressure   experiments.   Other
explanations, such as  a disorder-order transition, or  a  structural phase
transition, are not consistent with the all the available data.
<P>
        Since there  is no  direct experimental evidence  for a CDW in  C<SUB>4</SUB>KHg, there are many experimental  tests that should still be performed.
Temperature-dependent  electron  microscopy   and   transport  measurements
(<i>chi</i>(T) and <i>rho</i>(T)) have already been mentioned.  Other possibilities
are specific heat  experiments to directly  measure N(0) and  <i>Lambda</i><SUB>ep</SUB>, and
NMR or  ESR measurements to try to  learn more about the chemical  state of
the absorbed hydrogen.  In addition, studies of  T<SUB>c</SUB> as a  function of
H pressure are  desirable.  Some of these  measurements may be  carried out
with existing well-characterized samples by Prof.   T.  Enoki of  the Tokyo
Institute of Technology.  No doubt more surprises are in store.
<P>
        Like the KHg-GIC's,  the  CsBi-GIC's have several  in-plane phases.
The existence of superconductivity in the CsBi-GIC's has been controversial
due to reproducibility problems.[<A HREF="node66.html#lagrange87">145</A>]  The  various  T<SUB>c</SUB>'s
and multiple phases of the  CsBi-GIC's are obviously of  great interest for
comparison with the results described in this chapter.
