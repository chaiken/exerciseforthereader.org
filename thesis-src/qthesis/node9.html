	Work on artificially structured superconducting superlattices
up to 1984 was reviewed by Ruggiero and Beasley.[<A
HREF="node66.html#ruggiero85">209</A>] Results in the
superconductivity of artificial superlattices are much broader in
variety than those in the TMDC and their intercalation compounds,
encompassing such species as superconductor/superconductor (S/S'),
superconductor/normal metal (S/N), superconductor/insulator (S/I), and
superconductor/magnetic (S/M) compounds.  A greater variety of
materials combinations is possible with high-vacuum vapor-phase
deposition techniques because the sample grower is no longer limited
to phases which represent a global free-energy minimum.  These new
synthesis methods are just beginning to play a role in some areas of
materials research, but they have already made possible real advances
in the field of superconductivity.  <P>

        Some parameters from a few of the many recent superlattice
experiments are gathered in Table 2.3.  It is not possible to make a
neat summary of the superconductivity of the artificially structured
superlattices the way it is possible for the TMDC's.  The reason
clearly is that for any two materials that might be chosen for use in
a superlattice, a potentially unlimited range of thickness ratios can
be used.  This situation corresponds to having stages 1 through
infinity in an intercalation compound.  With modern preparation
techniques, even the "stage 1" limit of alternate monolayers of two
different materials may have been achieved in the Mo/Ta system.[<A
HREF="node66.html#makous87">160</A>]<p>

	The category of S/I superlattices was the first to be
investigated.  Pioneering work was done on the Al/Ge system by Haywood
and Ast.[<A HREF="node66.html#haywood78">105</A>] The dimensionality
crossover model of Klemm, Luther and Beasley[<A
HREF="node66.html#klemm75">131</A>] was developed specifically for the
S/I case, where the interlayer coupling occurs through tunnelling of
Cooper pairs through the insulating layers.  The excellent agreement
of the KLB model with H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) data for an S/I superlattice
(Nb/Ge) is shown in Figure 2.4.  The dimensional crossover here is
more impressive than it was in the case of the TMDCIC's, where there
were fewer data points on the 2D side of the curve.  <P>

<P> <BR><STRONG>Figure 2.4:</STRONG> Evidence for dimensionality
crossover in a Nb/Ge superlattice.[<A
HREF="node66.html#ruggiero82">208</A>] Solid lines are fits to the KLB
theory.[<A HREF="node66.html#klemm75">131</A>] The direction marked
``||'' means _|_ ^c in the vernacular of GIC's and the direction
marked ``_|_'' is || ^c in GIC terms.  The H<SUB>c2</SUB> data marked
_|_ is almost unaffected by the dimensionality crossover.  The
H<SUB>c2</SUB> data marked || covers the range from the fully 3D
regime (45 &#197;/ 7 &#197; specimen) to the fully 2D regime (45
&#197;/ 50 &#197; specimen).  The intermediate 65 &#197;/35 &#197;
specimen shows a crossover from 3D to 2D character as the temperature
is lowered.<BR>

        More recent studies have concentrated on S/S' and S/N
multilayers with niobium as one element.  The Josephson-tunnelling
theory does not apply quantitatively to these other types of
superlattices, because they are coupled through the superconducting
proximity effect.  The S/N and S/S' multilayers are described by new
proximity-effect theories.[<A HREF="node66.html#biagi85">22</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#takahashi86b">235</A>] Although these new models
differ in detail from the KLB model, the basic physics of the
progressive decoupling of superconducting layers at low temperatures
remains the same.  The root cause of the low-temperature decoupling of
superconducting layers is the decrease of the coherence length in each
case.  A dimensionality crossover has been observed in the critical
field behavior in several different systems, including the S/N systems
Nb/Cu,[<A HREF="node66.html#chun84">42</A>], and V/Ag,[<A
HREF="node66.html#kanoda86">126</A>] and the S/S' system Nb/Ta.[<A
HREF="node66.html#broussard87">30</A>] In these materials, as in the
TMDCIC's and S/I multilayers, the crossover is manifested by a
discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the critical field.
The identification of the kink in H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) with an effective
dimensionality change is confirmed by the good agreement obtained by
several groups[<A HREF="node66.html#chun84">42</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#broussard87">30</A>] with the different approximate
temperature dependences expected in the two regimes, namely the
(1-t)<SUP>1/2</SUP> dependence in the 2D temperature region and the
linear dependence near T<SUB>c</SUB>.  The linear-to-square-root
change in the temperature dependence in the Nb/Ta multilayers is shown
in Figure 2.5. <P>

 <P> <BR><STRONG>Figure 2.5:</STRONG> H<SUB>c2</SUB>(t) data on Nb/Ta
superlattices showing two low-temperature critical field
discontinuities.  From Ref. [<A
HREF="node66.html#broussard87">30</A>].  The discontinuity in slope at
t 0.8-0.9 is the 3D-2D coupling change.  The identity of the lower
transition at t = 0.49 has not been definitely determined.<BR> <P>

Figure 2.5 also demonstrates that the S/S' and S/N systems display
additional phenomena besides the coupling-dimensionality change.  The
Nb/Ta multilayers show a second low-temperature critical field
discontinuity after they have already become 2D-coupled.  The origin
of this second discontinuity is currently uncertain.  It may be due to
a shift of the flux-line-lattice from one set of layers to the
other.[<A HREF="node66.html#takahashi86c">236</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#broussard87b">28</A>] There is obviously a lot of
interesting work left to be done on the S/N and S/S' multilayers.  <P>

	In addition to the strong experimental confirmation of a
dimensionality crossover from the H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) measurements,
there is also positive corroboration from H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>)
data.  The Nb/Cu and Nb/Ta superconductors not only are fairly
well-fit by Eqn. 4.3 in the temperature range where their behavior is
three-dimensional, but they also are well-fit by Tinkham's formula
(Eqn. 4.9) in their 2D-coupled range.[<A
HREF="node66.html#chun84">42</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#broussard87">30</A>] The agreement of the two
different H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) formulae with Nb/Ta data in the
two different temperature regions is displayed in Figure 2.6.  The
observation of a change in the coupling dimensionality in both the
H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) and H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) measurements is
strong evidence that the KLB model contains the right physics.  <P>

<P><BR><STRONG>Figure 2.6:</STRONG> H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) data
on Nb/Ta superlattices from Ref. [<A
HREF="node66.html#broussard88">29</A>].  The data is for three samples
at a reduced temperature t = 0.9.  <i>Lambda</i> is the bilayer
period, which corresponds to I<SUB>c</SUB> in the GIC case.  Data in
the trace marked 3D are fit with Eqn. 4.3 while data in the traces
marked 2D are fit with Eqn. 4.6.<BR> <P>

        Interpretation of the angular dependence of the
superconducting superlattices is not as clear-cut as the temperature
dependence, where more universal behavior is seen.  As shown in Figure
2.6 in the crossover region neither the 3D nor 2D formulae fits well.
Chun <em> et al.</em> found a continuous variation between the 2D-type
and 3D-type H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) behavior.  Ruggiero <em> et
al.</em> observed better agreement with Tinkham's formula in both the
2D and 3D regions of temperature.[<A
HREF="node66.html#ruggiero82">208</A>] While the agreement of theory
and H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) experiments for some of the S/I and
S/N systems at most temperatures is gratifying, it is clear that the
behavior of H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) in anisotropic
superconductors is not completely understood.[<A
HREF="node66.html#broussard87">30</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#ruggiero82">208</A>] The agreement between the
H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>) data and the two available formulae is
usually at the semiquantitative level in the artificially structured
superlattices, while the agreement in H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) is usually
quite good quantitatively.[<A HREF="node66.html#ruggiero82">208</A>]
Quite possibly a calculation of the angular dependence of
H<SUB>c2</SUB> near the dimensionality crossover in terms of the KLB
and the proximity models would solve all these discrepancies. Such
calculations have not been performed up to this point.  <P>

        Another somewhat puzzling aspect of the superconducting
superlattice experiments is the positive curvature often observed in
H<SUB>c2, || ^c</SUB>.  Such positive curvature has been seen in both
the Nb/Cu and Nb/Ta systems.[<A HREF="node66.html#chun84">42</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#broussard87">30</A>] The coupling-dimensionality
change should have no effect on H<SUB>c2</SUB> when the field is
applied perpendicular to the layer planes since this critical field is
determined solely by the in-plane transport properties.  Broussard and
Geballe[<A HREF="node66.html#broussard87">30</A>] have attributed this
positive curvature to the Fermi surface anisotropy of the Nb layers
since it is similar to the positive curvature of Nb thin films.
Biagi, Kogan, and Clem, on the other hand, say that the positive
curvature seen in H<SUB>c2, || ^c</SUB> is due to the proximity
effect.[<A HREF="node66.html#biagi85">22</A>] <P>

        Many interesting experiments have been performed on the
superconducting multilayers besides the critical field experiments, as
Table 2.3 suggests.  The most relevant of these for the GIC work is
the measurement of T<SUB>c</SUB> for different layer thicknesses.  An
example is shown in Figure 2.7, where T<SUB>c</SUB> is plotted versus
layer thickness for the Nb/Cu multilayers.  For large layer
thicknesses, the increase of T<SUB>c</SUB> with increasing thickness
of the superconducting component is in accord with the predictions of
standard proximity-effect theories.[<A
HREF="node66.html#cooper61">49</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#degennes66">54</A>] The standard proximity-effect
prediction is indicated by the solid line.  For small layer
thicknesses, the proximity theory needs some modifications to explain
the data.  The dashed line is also a proximity-effect calculation, but
it incorporates a thickness-dependent T<SUB>c</SUB> for the individual
Nb layers.[<A HREF="node66.html#banerjee84">14</A>] <P>

        Note that the proximity effect is a feature of all interfaces
formed by superconductors.  It should not be confused with proximity
<em> coupling</em>, which is a manifestation of the proximity effect
that occurs only in the S/N and S/S' superlattices.  Proximity
coupling is the interlayer interaction in S/N superlattices which is
mediated by the diffusion of Cooper pairs across the N layer.  S/I
interfaces can also exhibit the proximity effect, but proximity-effect
depression of T<SUB>c</SUB> is quite small there.  The size of the
proximity-effect depression of T<SUB>c</SUB> goes as the factor
<i>eta</i>, which is the ratio of the normal-state conductivities of
the normal and superconducting layers (<i>eta</i> =
<i>sigma</i><SUB>N</SUB> / <i>sigma</i><SUB>S</SUB>).[<A
HREF="node66.html#ruggiero82">208</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#degennes66">54</A>] Thus proximity effects are
almost negligible at S/I interfaces.  Because the proximity effect is
too weak to couple the layers in S/I superlattices, the layers are
coupled instead by Josephson tunnelling.[<A
HREF="node66.html#ruggiero85">209</A>] The good agreement of the
artificially structured superlattices with proximity-effect theories
is in contrast with the mixed results for TDMCIC's (and GIC's).  <P>

<BR><STRONG>Figure 2.7:</STRONG> T<SUB>c</SUB> vs layer thickness in
Nb/Cu superlattices.  From Ref. [<A
HREF="node66.html#banerjee84">14</A>].  The decrease of T<SUB>c</SUB>
with decreasing thickness of the superconducting component is
predicted by proximity-effect theories.[<A
HREF="node66.html#cooper61">49</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#degennes66">54</A>] The predictions of the standard
proximity-effect theories is indicated by the solid line.  The
proximity effect calculation modified to allow a thickness-dependent
T<SUB>c</SUB> for the Nb layers is indicated by the dashed line.<BR>
<P>

        The study of metallic multilayers has been a growth area in
physics and materials science.[<A HREF="node66.html#mrs87">15</A>]
Already there have been some significant results from superconducting
multilayers.  The most impressive of these is the unambiguous
observation of a coupling-dimensionality crossover in both
 H<SUB>c2</SUB>(T) and H<SUB>c2</SUB>(<i>theta</i>).[<A
HREF="node66.html#ruggiero82">208</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#chun84">42</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#kanoda86">126</A>,<A
HREF="node66.html#broussard87">30</A>] The real promise of the
synthetic superlattices lies in the studies of new effects not easily
observable in GIC's or TMDCIC's, such as the competition between
superconductivity and magnetism in Mo/Ni superlattices,[<A
HREF="node66.html#uher86">256</A>] or the two low-temperature
transitions observed in the Nb/Ta superlattices.[<A
HREF="node66.html#broussard87">30</A>] The superconducting multilayer
work has been somewhat eclipsed by the excitement over
high-temperature superconductors, but hopefully it will continue to be
pursued, both because of its intrinsic interest and its relevance to
the high- T<SUB>c</SUB> field.  <P>
