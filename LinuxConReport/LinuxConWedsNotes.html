<h3>"MeeGo: Where are We Now"</h3>
Dawn Foster, MeeGo Community Manager<br/>
Intel Corporation<br/>

<p>
Foster described the merger of the Maemo and Moblin projects into
MeeGo as a logical joining of efforts with similar objectives.  Foster
explained that MeeGo will feature netbook, handset and in-vehicle
infotainment (IVI) "user experiences" plus others that haven't been
considered yet.  Central to all the UE is a common core of code that
is the heart of MeeGo.  The intention is that developers can use the
core to create applications and then easily deploy to all the UEs.
Porting apps from the Linux desktop is also intended to be
straightforward since MeeGo is rather straightforward GNU/Linux,
unlike (for example) Android.  The netbook UE is already available for
download and the "in-vehicle infotainment" one has just been
published.  While MeeGo can be installed on Nokia N900 handsets, the
combination is considered rather experimental.  MeeGo-based handsets
should be shipping by Christmas.</p>

<p>Foster showed a rather impressive demo of MeeGo on a Toshiba
Atom-powered netbook.  MeeGo is pretty and appears to be both stable
and snappy.  The boot time of the Toshiba netbook to the MeeGo desktop
was fairly impressive -- maybe about 10 seconds from power-on.  The
home screen is arranged as a window with tabs representing different
kinds of activities, and navigation is intuitive.  At one point, about
a dozen error messages popped up about WiFi dropping.  The dropped
network is hardly surprising in the context of a technical conference,
but the profusion of duplicative messages was more concerning.
MeeGo is a bit cute for hard-core Linux users but may well appeal to
people who want to use a web browser and answer email.    It's a shame
that MeeGo did not arrive in time to ride the wave of netbook sales
growth that occurred a couple of years ago.   Watching Foster's
netbook-based demo, I'm curious to see how usable the handset "user
experience" will be.</p>

<h3>"Freedom to Innovate: Can MeeGo's Openness Change the Mobile
Industry?"</h3>
Tom Miller, Nokia<br/>
Dean Speed, Intel<br/>

<p>Intel's AppUp store is for libraries and other middleware as well as
full-blown applications.    OEMs can rebrand AppUp and host on Intel's
platform if they wish.    Nokia's Ovi website is more of a traditional
app store.</p>

<p>The Qt project is now hosted on gitorious and is fully open source.  A
port of Qt to Android is underway.</p>

<p>An audience member asked about the situation with DRMed media content
on media and Miller answered that music buyers would not be restricted
to Nokia's music store.  Clearly the questioner was hoping to get a
higher-level answer about the situation with proprietary codecs on
MeeGo.</p>

<p>An audience member asked if other CPU vendors and handset
manufacturers can now ship MeeGo.   The two representatives agreed
that there were no barriers to other vendors competing on MeeGo.   A
follow-up question about locking of MeeGo devices was not answered,
implying that at least some of them will in fact be locked.</p>


<h3>"Open Development of Medical Devices"</h3>
Karen Sandler, Software Freedom Law Center

<p>The fact that the firmware of medical devices is not only secret but
untested by the FDA is appalling.    The case of voting systems has
illustrated how important the openness of societally critical software
is.    FDA has no staff with expertise to evaluate firmware and has
promulgated no standards with regard to it.   Furthermore, FDA
jurisdiction effectively means that patients who are injured by
defective but approved devices are severely constrained in their right
to sue.   Before getting her own medical implant, Sandler carefully
considered the firmware safety of the various types of devices before
making her choice.   To get even the limited information she received,
Sandler had to contact the manufacturers directly, and even there she
was largely shut out.</p>


<h3>"Saving Energy with the intel_idle cpuidle driver"</h3>
Len Brown, Intel

<p><a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/slides/2010/linuxcon2010_brown.pdf">Slides</a></p>

<p>Brown, following Wysocki and Garrett, presented the third in a series
of excellent talks about recent power management developments in the
Linux kernel.  Brown's work has focussed on successive idle states of
a laptop CPU (C states and P states) as opposed to Wysocki's
description of mainline's approach to peripheral device power
management and Garrett's thoughts about handset power states and the
divergent Android approach.</p>

<p>Power management is an area where Linux has recently been innovative
and is just plain outperforming Windows.   </p>

<p>C and P states are specified in the ACPI protocol, whose purpose is to
make Linux work with Windows-intended hardware.  The names of the
states vary a bit by architecture.  Not all states are supported on
all architectures.  Poorly designed criteria for entering and leaving
the states can actually waste power, as the transitions cost energy.
Getting out of P states (where devices and buses are powered off) is
more expensive than getting out of C states, where just the processor
is partially or fully powered down.</p>

<p>Intel's power management software never promotes the system to a
deeper sleep than is explicitly requested, while AMD's sometimes
does. </p>

<p>When Brown's improvements to cpu_idle were first complete, the first
Dell product to ship with the new software had a Windows-motivated
BIOS bug which prevented the kernel from taking advantage of the new
features.  The BIOS soon had a patch, but of course very few consumers
update firmware.  The situation was frustrating to Brown, to say the
least!</p>

<p>Wysocki's newish PM_QOS allows dynamically loaded drivers to prevent
sleeps.  BIOS typically forces changes in power state settings up
transition from mains to battery power.  Using PM_QOS is more flexible
when control of the transitions can be wrestled away from the BIOS.</p>

<p>cpu_freq for dynamically changing the processor clock has a huge table
of parameters.    By comparison, intel_idle is relatively simple.
Users can check dmesg for an mwait statement to see if intel_idle is
ready to run.</p>

<p>Despite difficulties that lack of control over BIOS presents, coreboot
project is not a solution, as, according to Brown, it "will never work
with commercial machines," only with embedded systems.</p>

<p>PCIe has better power-saving potential than PCI.    Apple does an
excellent job in power-saving on laptops since they control the whole
stack.   Fedora 13 often doesn't suspend when Brown expects it to;
he hasn't yet discovered why.</p>

<p>turbostat is a useful diagnostic tool for viewing per-core C states,
available as part of pmtools on kernel.org.  powertop is a similar
tool but tends to be buggier.  The goal of cpu_idle is to spend as
much time in the higher P states (PC3 and PC6) with peripherals turned
off as possible.</p>


<h3>"Doing What it Takes: Current Legal Issues in Defending FOSS"</h3>
Eben Moglen, Software Freedom Law Center

<p>Moglen believes that Linux is well-established as a viable business
and argues that it is now clear that commercial and "sharing" models
of commerce can peacefully coexist.  He emphasized that he personally
is for capitalism if not of it.</p>

<p>The threat to Linux from copyright attacks is now largely passed.
Unfortunately, after the Bilski decision, it's clear that software
patents are with us indefinitely, and they continue to be a threat.</p>
