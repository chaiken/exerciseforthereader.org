<h3>Trade show</h3>

<p>The trade show featured tables with representatives from the Linux
  Foundation's major sponsors.   The MeeGo demo appeared to be the
  biggest hit.   Intel, Nokia, FSF, Fedora, and a host of smaller
  companies all had displays.
</p>

<h3>Women in Free Software dinner</h3>

<p>There were about 15 attendees at the women's dinner. Although only 3
  of us attended the conference and probably fewer than half were
  women, the dinner was still lots of fun.
</p>

<h3>Thinkpads</h3>

<p>More than one person has now told me that most kernel developers
  own Lenovo Thinkpads, which consequently have the best driver
  support.    I know what kind of laptop I'm getting next.
</p>

<h3>Espressos</h3>

<p>On his blog, Torvalds revealed that he had consumed 13744 espressos
  made with his home machine in two years of hard kernel development.
