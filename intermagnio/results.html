      Experimental Results
    </h1>
    <p>
      <a href="fig1.html">Figure 1a</a> shows the easy and hard
      axis magnetization of a NiO(500&Aring;)/NiFe(100&Aring;)
      deposited on Si with an amorphous Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
      film. The NiO film is untextured with a grain size in the
      growth direction, derived from the FWHM of the NiO(200) Bragg
      peak, of 80&Aring;. The easy axis loop is offset by
      H<sub>E</sub> = 66 Oe which corresponds to an interface
      exchange energy of J = 0.046 erg/cm<sup>2</sup>. The largest
      value we observed was J = 0.065 erg/cm<sup>2</sup>. The
      energies are in agreement with those observed by [1] .
      NiCoO/NiFe, and NiO/Co bilayers with promising exchange
      fields have also been fabricated using this new IBS
      sputtering technique <a href="fig1.html">Figure 1b</a> shows
      the magnetization of a bilayer deposited simultaneously with
      the films shown in <a href="fig1.html">Figure 1a</a>, but on
      a polished single crystal (001) oriented MgO substrate. XRD
      shows both the NiO and the NiFe are highly (001) textured.
      The magnetization of the NiFe shows evidence of both a
      induced uniaxial anisotropy along the H<sub>b</sub> axis, and
      unidirectional anisotropy defined by the direction of
      H<sub>b</sub>. <a href="fig1.html">Figure 1b</a> shows M(H)
      in the in-plane (100) directions, one parallel to
      H<sub>b</sub> and one perpendicular to H<sub>b</sub>. The
      exchange field H<sub>E</sub> is 20 Oe (J = 0.015
      erg/cm<sup>2</sup>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The dependence of H<sub>E</sub> on the thickness of the IBS
      grown NiO and NiFe layers was measured. Consistent with other
      studies [7] , the exchange field agrees with
      t<sub>NiFe</sub><sup>-1</sup> behavior for 300&Aring; &gt;
      t<sub>NiFe</sub> &gt; 50&Aring; and t<sub>NiO</sub> =
      500&Aring;, as expected from the interfacial origin of the
      interaction. The H<sub>E</sub> is approximately constant for
      t<sub>NiO</sub> &gt; 400&Aring;, and decreases to zero at a
      critical thickness of about 175&Aring;. The easy axis
      coercivity peaks near the critical thickness. The optimum NiO
      thickness where the difference between H<sub>E</sub> and
      H<sub>c</sub> is maximum is between 400&Aring; and
      500&Aring;. Finally we find the training effect, which is the
      reduction of H<sub>E</sub> after multiple field cycles, is
      largest for NiO thicknesses near the critical thickness. No
      training effect was observed for NiO films greater than
      400&Aring;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morphology of the NiO deposited on an amorphous buffer
      layer is sensitive to the detailed deposition conditions. We
      have studied the effect of substrate deposition temperature,
      beam voltage, deposition rate and substrate voltage bias on
      the texture of 500&Aring; thick NiO layers. We observe
      NiO(111), (200) and (220) Bragg reflections with various
      intensities (the positions indicate the NiO lattice is
      expanded relative to bulk by 1%). We find, however, that
      H<sub>E</sub> is not sensitive to the changes in the bulk NiO
      morphology detected at this level. Though we find variations
      in the strength of H<sub>E</sub> they are not correlated to
      variation on the NiO texture. This conclusion is illustrated
      in <a href="fig2.html">Figure 2</a> where the interface
      exchange energy, J = H<sub>E</sub> M<sub>s</sub>
      t<sub>NiFe</sub>, for a wide range of
      NiO(500&Aring;)/NiFe(tNiFe) films is plotted as a function of
      the ratio of the NiO(111) to the NiO(200) Bragg peak
      intensities. The data are space-filling indicating that the
      bulk texture of the NiO layer is not a good predictor of the
      strength of the interface coupling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Neel transition temperature, T<sub>N</sub>, for bulk NiO
      is 250&deg;C. The H<sub>E</sub> of NiO/NiFe bilayers
      typically drops to zero at a lower blocking temperature, Tb,
      which also varies with the interface and bulk morphological
      properties of the bilayer couple [7] . The temperature
      dependence of H<sub>E</sub> and H<sub>c</sub> of an IBS grown
      NiO(500&Aring;)/NiFe(50&Aring;) coupled film is shown in <a
      href="fig3.html">Figure 3</a>. H<sub>E</sub> drops
      approximately linearly with increasing temperature reaching a
      blocking temperature of T<sub>b</sub> = 200&deg;C in this
      film. The slope of the decrease in H<sub>E</sub> with
      temperature is approximately the same for all of the films
      measured, indicating that the room temperature exchange field
      is a good predictor of T<sub>b</sub>. H<sub>c</sub> also
      decreases with increasing temperature but at a slower rate
      reaching the room temperature value of a free NiFe layer (1-2
      Oe) at 230&deg;C. Temperature cycles above TN with subsequent
      cooling in modest fields reduced H<sub>c</sub> of the NiFe
      from 84 Oe to 60 Oe, but did not change H<sub>E</sub>
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some bilayer films no offset was produced in the NiFe
      magnetization loop by the NiO buffer, but a large room
      temperature coercivity as well as a clear uniaxial anisotropy
      was observed, (H<sub>c</sub> = 35 Oe and H<sub>s</sub> = 80
      Oe as compared to H<sub>c</sub> = 1-2 Oe and H<sub>s</sub> =
      5 Oe in a free NiFe layer). This enhanced H<sub>c</sub>
      indicates that interface exchange coupling is present, but
      that it averages to zero [8],[9] . The temperature dependence
      of H<sub>ce</sub> in such a film composed of
      NiO(355&Aring;)/NiFe(100&Aring;) is also shown in <a href=
      "fig3.html">Figure 3</a>. The coercivity drops with
      increasing temperature similar to the behavior seen in films
      with H<sub>E</sub> &gt;0, reaching 1-2 Oe at 130&deg;C. The
      hard axis saturation field has similar temperature
      dependence. The reduced temperature where H<sub>ce</sub> goes
      to zero may be a result of a reduced T<sub>N</sub> for the
      thinner NiO layer, however it seems more likely that the
      reduction is linked in the same way as the lack of
      H<sub>E</sub> to the interfacial properties.
