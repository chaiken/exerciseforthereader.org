      Discussion
    </h1>
    <p>
      The simplest model desribing NiO/NiFe exchange coupling
      indicates the highest HE should be observed when the NiO
      surface is oriented to maximize the number of uncompensated
      spins, i. e. the (111) planes [10] . We have shown that this
      model clearly does not describe NiO/NiFe exchange couples.
      The data represented in <a href="fig2.html">Figure 2</a>
      indicate the bulk texture of the NiO layer has very little
      influence on the interface exchange coupling energy since the
      exchange field does not correlate with the texture of the NiO
      films. Further, <a href="fig1.html">Figure 1b</a> shows a
      strong H<sub>E</sub> for NiFe films grown on the (001) thus
      should produce zero exchange field. The substrate thus should
      produce zero exchange field. The substrate properties
      influence H<sub>E</sub>, however, since H<sub>E</sub> for the
      bilayer on MgO is roughly one third that of the
      polycrystalline film deposited simultaneously on an amorphous
      buffer layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our results agree with [5] who use an MOCVD technique to grow
      epitaxial (001) oriented NiO buffer layers. They also find
      non-zero HE values for NiFe grown on (001) oriented NiO,
      which are roughly half what they measure for NiFe grown on
      polycrystalline NiO buffers. However, they measure isotropic
      coercivities which are nearly an order of magnitude larger
      than those of reactively sputtered or IBS NiO films. This
      difference in coercivity may be due to the elevated surface
      roughness of the epitaxial MOCVD NiO layers relative to those
      deposited using the other techniques. [11] describes NiFe
      layers deposited on single crystal CoO substrates and shows
      that rougher interfaces or interfaces with more crystalline
      disorder produce higher exchange fields (CoO has structural
      and magnetic properties similar to NiO). Growth studies of
      IBS films indicate the broad distribution of adatom energies
      present in IBS deposition can produce very smooth surfaces
      and interfaces [12]. Low angle XRD data on the IBS grown
      NiO/NiFe bilayers show the surface has approximately 5&Aring;
      of roughness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, models for the bilayer magnetic response should
      divide the NiO into two layers. We can estimate the thickness
      of a surface layer in the NiO, whose spins are dynamic during
      the NiFe reversal and so are responsible for the large NiFe
      coercivity, is equal to the critical NiO thickness needed to
      produce the unidirectional exchange anisotropy. A static NiO
      layer below the dynamic layer establishes the direction of
      HE. Large H<sub>E</sub> are observed independent of the
      texture of the NiO layer. Thus the interfacial interaction of
      the NiFe and the NiO is not influenced by the average NiO
      morphology. Unfortunately it is difficult to probe the
      properties of the interface independently of the rest of the
      NiO film and observe the magnetic structures that form.
      Variations in H<sub>c</sub> and H<sub>E</sub> in coupled
      bilayers as well as the presence of a critical thickness, and
      the training effect, indicate that the dynamics of the
      interfacial antiferromagnetic domain structure of the NiO
      during the NiFe magnetization reversal is the key to
      understanding the magnetic response of oxide based exchange
      couples.[8]
    </p>
    <p>
      The antiferromagnetic order of the NiO and the presence of
      non-zero H<sub>E</sub> is unaffected by bulk morphological
      variations. In this sense, the NiO is a more forgiving
      exchange bias layer than FeMn/NiFe or NiMn/NiFe exchange
      couples, since these compounds require the specific FCC
      structure throughout the buffer layer to produce the
      antiferromagnetic phase and achieve a non-zero
      H<sub>E</sub>.[13] This difference may be due to the more
      robust antiferromagnetism associated with the super-exchange
      interaction and ionic bonding in the oxide materials.
