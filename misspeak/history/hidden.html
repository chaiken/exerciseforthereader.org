    <p>
      You might have to close your eyes to see the rich past of
      Hidden Valley on a Warms Springs hillside below <a href=
      "/misspeak/">Mission Peak</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the centuries, the Ohlone, Spanish, Mexicans,
      Californios, Americans and others played and relaxed in the
      warm resort waters of Agua Caliente (warm springs) Creek in
      Fremont.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today posh new homes have replaced the exclusive hotel and
      spa resort of the late 19th century.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the heart of this modern upper-crust village is a lone,
      old winery building that can't begin to measure the
      importance of the site along <a href=
      "/misspeak/stanave/">Stanford Avenue</a>. It is
      destined to become a small community center.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just about everything else from previous eras is gone except
      for the walls of a stone winery building on private property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stand at the corner of Stanford and Vineyard avenues and you
      can hear the babble of the creek that played such an
      important part in Warm Springs' past.
    </p>
    <p>
      In your mind's eye, you can see the people who used its
      once-warm waters to bathe, wash their clothes or heal their
      weary bodies. They were the American Indians of ancient
      times, the Mexican and Spanish of the era of exploration, and
      the American settlers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last major building there was the <a href=
      "cohen.html">A.A. Cohen Hotel</a>, which burned down in 1992.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three-story, white-with-red-trim hotel -- the only
      surviving building from a 19th-century spa -- was part of the
      first hot springs resort on the West Coast. When it opened in
      the early 1850s, it catered to the elite of the new state of
      California.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Clement Columbet opened the spa, there were 10 buildings
      on both sides of Agua Caliente Creek. Springs fed warm soda-,
      borax- and sulfur-enhanced water into the basement of six
      buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its heyday, the spa attracted the likes of Pio Pico, the
      last Mexican governor of California; Sen. George Hearst of
      the newspaper empire; Domingo Ghiradelli of the chocolate
      family; and Adolph Sutro, mayor of San Francisco and owner of
      a competing bath at the Cliff House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spa's life was cut short in 1868 when a 7.5-magnitude
      earthquake shattered the East Bay along the Hayward Fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later owned by the Stanford family, the ranch was once
      considered a possible site for Stanford University. Now the
      only place to get a higher education there is to climb
      Mission Peak above.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years, Hidden Valley ranch was rented out for
      company and group picnics, and the hotel housed a bar and
      Mexican restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is best known as the onetime home of Leland Stanford, who
      entered the Warm Springs scene in 1869.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New York native and Wisconsin lawyer came to California
      in 1852 and joined his two brothers in running a chain of
      hardware stores supplying gold miners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later Stanford and three Sacramento merchants -- Collis P.
      Huntington, Charles Crocker and Mark Hopkins -- agreed to
      underwrite the western link of the transcontinental railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stanford was chosen president of Central Pacific, later known
      as the Southern Pacific Railroad. He was elected governor on
      the pro-Lincoln ticket in 1861 and after a two year term
      resumed his duties as railroad president.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven years later, Stanford bought the Warm Springs property,
      about 4,000 acres that ran from today's Mission Boulevard to
      the top of Mission Peak.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the stories go, Warm Springs could have been the site of
      Stanford University, except that his wife, Jane, preferred
      living on the Peninsula.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Stanfords were living on their Palo Alto farm when, in
      1884, their 15-year-old son, Leland Jr., died.
    </p>
    <p>
      They established Stanford University in their son's memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Stanford home in Warm Springs was demolished sometime in
      the last decade. The <a href=
      "monument.jpg">rock-and-brass</a> monument and the little
      brick winery building is the last vestige of the Stanfords'
      presence on this side of the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Stanford died in 1893 in Palo Alto at the age of
      69, and he probably died happy. His last meal, a few hours
      earlier, included nine lamb chops.
