      Fremont's highest residence, at about 2,000 feet above sea
      level, is so high that its nearest neighbors are goats on the
      craggy face of Mission Peak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reader <strong>Alison Chaiken</strong> wondered about this
      place and penned this letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dear Dennis,<br />
      Now that you have explained why the salt evaporators turn
      color and and how Warm Springs got its name, can you find out
      about the goats at the top of Mission Peak? Are these goats
      native, or were they released there? Also what is the "park
      residence" building -- a private home?<br />
      Thanks in advance.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      You're welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goats are probably the offspring of domestic goats that
      went wild many years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      One story is that years ago, the goats were turned loose for
      hunters to track down and barbecue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunters never got them all, and the goat population grew
      and became a hazard. The goats are a little clumsy, knocking
      rocks loose and sending them tumbling into Hidden Valley, an
      area you can't see from the flatlands but is just below the
      rocky crown of Mission Peak. You will notice a lot of big
      rocks on the valley floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were 35 goats on the peak in 1987, said <strong>Ned
      MacKay</strong>, spokesman for the East Bay Regional Park
      District. All but 5 or 6 were rounded up and given to Ken
      McWilliams, who added them to his goat herd that is used to
      keep down grass in some of the other parks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current goat population on Mission Peak is about eight.
      Four baby goats born this year died.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rose Brittan</strong>, who lives in the wooden,
      single-story park residence with her family in Hidden Valley,
      said she thinks the kids might have succumbed to
      complications due to inbreeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can hike to the area from trailheads at the end of
      <a href="/misspeak/stanave/">Stanford Avenue</a> and
      the south side of <a href="/misspeak/ohlone/">Ohlone
      College</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the goats, if you're lucky, you might see
      bobcats, deer, coyotes, golden eagles, turkey vultures,
      prairie falcons and red-tailed hawks in the air or among the
      locust, elderberry, bay and oak trees in the tiny valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The park residence is the old <a href=
      "/misspeak/history/mcclure.html">McClure ranch
      house</a>, which has no electricity and sometimes no running
      water. It sits on park property now and, as with houses in
      most of the East Bay Regional District parks, is inhabited by
      an employee who pays nominal rent in exchange for providing
      security. The park residence is off-limits to hikers, but
      someone is usually there in case of an emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mackay said the McClure ranch buildings are some of the
      oldest still standing in Alameda County. The four, including
      a barn, cook's quarters and a storage shed, were constructed
      about 1855.
    </p>
    <p>
      The property was owned over the years by Fremont pioneer
      <strong>Stephen Millard</strong>, then <strong>Leland
      Stanford</strong>, <strong>A.A. Moore</strong> and finally
      Moore's daughter <strong>Margaret Moore McClure</strong>. She
      sold the 103-acre Hidden Valley property to the park district
      in 1978 for $80,000 on condition that she be allowed to live
      there for the rest of her life. She died six years ago [in
      1986] at the age of 91, and her home was converted into a
      park residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her final years, park officials say, McClure spent much of
      her time sitting in a chair and staring at Mission Peak and
      the goats.
