      History Ablaze: Historic Hotel in Fremont Burns<br />
    </h2>

    <p>
      Fremont's historic A.A. Cohen Hotel is no more.<br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was destroyed early Saturday in a raging fire that shot
      flames 100 feet into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Flames were visible from Grimmer Boulevard and Auto Mall
      Parkway two miles away," fire department spokesman Dennis
      Satariano said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two-alarm fire, reported at 2:49 a.m., destroyed all of
      the French-style roof and gables, the third floor and most of
      the second floor, leaving only the charred walls of the first
      floor. The fire was under control at 4:16 a.m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fire investigators said the blaze started near the fireplace
      and may have been ignited by someone living in the building
      who was trying to keep warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circa-1850 hotel just off <a href=
      "/misspeak/stanave/">Stanford Avenue</a> in <a href=
      "hidden.html">Warm Springs</a> was awaiting demolition to
      make way for luxury homes. But members of the historical
      society were hoping to save parts of the building when it was
      demolished.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''I'm sick about it," said Cecilia Weed, president of the
      Washington Township Historical Society. When she visited the
      building recently, Weed said, there was evidence that people
      were living there. "I wanted to save the whole front, the
      trim on the windows and the windows. It had beautiful
      windows."
    </p>
    <p>
      The three-story, white-with-red-trim hotel -- the only
      surviving building from a 19th-century spa -- was part of the
      first hot springs resort on the West Coast. When it opened in
      the early 1850s, it catered to the elite of the new state of
      California.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Frenchman Clement Columbet opened the spa, there were 10
      buildings on both sides of Aqua Caliente (Warm Springs)
      Creek. Springs fed warm soda-, borax- and sulfur-enhanced
      water into the basement baths of six buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the time of the Ohlone, people bathed in the warm
      springs that gave the area its name. Spanish explorers washed
      their clothes there.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its heyday, the spa attracted the likes of Pio Pico, the
      last Mexican governor of California; Sen. George Hearst of
      the newspaper empire; Domingo Ghirardelli of the chocolate
      family; and Adolph Sutro, mayor of San Francisco and owner of
      a competing bath at the Cliff House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spa's life was cut short in 1868 when a 7.5-magnitude
      earthquake shattered the East Bay along the Hayward Fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later owned by the Stanford family, the ranch once was
      considered a possible site for Stanford University.
    </p>
    <p>
      More recently, the ranch was rented out for company and group
      picnics, and the hotel housed a bar and Mexican restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past five years, there have been sputtering attempts
      to save the building, but they all failed and the structure
      was approved for demolition.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent weeks, the Fremont Fire Department had conducted
      drills there but did not set any fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankel Enterprises plans to build 18 houses on the 23-acre
      Hidden Valley Ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the remains of the building were unstable, city
      officials Saturday ordered the rest of the building razed
      immediately.
