      MISSION PEAK: REACHING THE TOP NO WALK IN THE PARK
    </p>

      Soaring vultures and hang gliders provide visual
      entertainment for hikers who reach the top of Fremont's
      Mission Peak, one of the Bay Area's most accessible summits.
      Three trails give day hikers a choice of moderate to
      strenuous routes to the promontory, which at 2,517 feet above
      sea level provides a view of Mount Hamilton, Mount Diablo,
      Silicon Valley and San Francisco. On the clearest winter
      days, the Sierra Nevada may be just visible. The shortest and
      hardest route starts at the east end of <a href=
      "/misspeak/stanave/">Stanford Avenue</a> in Fremont.
      From the parking lot, hikers head up a wide trail that varies
      from moderate to steep -- mostly steep. This route offers a
      panoramic view of much of the Bay Area. With few trees, it's
      a good choice in cool weather but not in the summer. A choice
      of trails means hikers can turn their trek into a loop hike;
      total distance on any route is about 5 1/2 miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also popular is a slightly longer trail that begins at
      <a href="/misspeak/ohlone/">Ohlone College</a>, on
      Mission Boulevard in Fremont. This more gradual ascent begins
      behind the swimming pool at the college's southeast corner.
      The trail often narrows to a single track. Hikers on this
      trail see more trees and wildflowers than Stanford Avenue
      starters, as they wind behind Mission Peak above Mill Creek
      Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third, seldom-used path starts at <a href=
      "/misspeak/sunol/">Sunol Regional Wilderness</a> and
      follows a gently climbing route east to the peak. This
      pleasant trail requires more time, money and planning but is
      worth the effort. Hikers must pay to park at Sunol, and then
      each must buy an Ohlone Wilderness Trail permit allowing
      passage across San Francisco Water Department land. The round
      trip comes to 11 miles. The end result of any route is a good
      workout and a tremendous view of many of the Bay Area's
      landmarks, plus close-up looks at the hang gliders who use
      Mission Peak as their launch pad. (There is actually a fourth
      route to Mission Peak, from <a href=
      "/misspeak/levin/">Ed Levin County Park</a> in
      Milpitas, but the 10-mile route requires leaving a car at
      each end, making for a very long day. Finding the trail head
      in Levin Park can be a challenge, too.)
    </p>
    <p>
      WHAT YOU'LL NEED: The top of Mission Peak is windy, and
      considerably colder than the trail heads. Carry warm
      clothing, especially for children. Bring lots of water, food
      and sunscreen. Binoculars and field guides to birds and
      wildflowers are heavy but useful additions.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHO'S ALLOWED: Dogs are allowed on all trails and may be off
      the leash as long as they are under control and the owner is
      carrying a leash. Horses are allowed on all routes. Bicycles
      are not allowed on the trail from Sunol.
    </p>
    <p>
      GETTING THERE: For the Stanford Avenue trail head in south
      Fremont, take the first Mission Boulevard Exit northbound on
      Interstate 680 and go east. Turn right on Stanford Avenue
      (look for Mission Peak Regional Preserve sign) and drive to
      the end. Parking is free. For the Ohlone College trail head,
      take the second Mission Boulevard Exit (Highway 238) from
      Interstate 680. Drive past Mission San Jose and turn left
      into the Ohlone College parking lot. Parking costs $1.50 when
      classes are in session.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Sunol Regional Wilderness trail head, take the
      Calaveras Road Exit from Interstate 680. Turn east on
      Calaveras and then go left on Geary Road, which goes into the
      park. Parking costs $3; trail permits are $2 per person. Sign
      in and out at trail heads. Take note of when the park gate
      closes (it varies by season) so you don't get locked in.
    </p>
