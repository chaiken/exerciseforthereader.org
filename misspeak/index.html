      <strong>Mission Peak Trailmap</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a <a href="/misspeak/map.html">map</a> of the
      trails on Mission Peak, a popular hiking spot in Fremont, CA.
      The map was made from the GPS tracklogs of separate hikes up
      to the summit from the Sunol, Stanford Avenue, Ohlone and Ed
      Levin trailheads. Much more technical information is
      available on our <a href="/wolfgang/gps/">GPS page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mission Peak Trail Profiles</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some topographic profiles of the trails up Mission
      Peak. These profiles were generated from tracklogs and
      waypoints made using a <a href=
      "http://www.garmin.com/">Garmin</a> GPS receiver with
      differential correction. The elevations were recorded by
      hand, since the Garmin 12XL does not include elevations as
      part of waypoint data. The lateral coordinates are good to
      Â±2m, while the <a href=
      "/misspeak/elevations.html">elevation data</a> are
      somewhat less accurate. The distances displayed are the
      integrated distance along the trail as obtained from the
      tracklog, which is taken at much higher spatial resolution
      than the waypoint data.

      report</a> (including several geological maps) concerning the
      famous <em>Mission Peak landslide</em>.  Highlights: "Mission
      Peak and Mission Ridge are comprised of a resistant plug of
      overturned Briones sandstone which appears to have been thrust
      upward between eastern and western traces of the Mission fault
      . . . The site lies within a tectonically active zone. Mission
      Ridge appears to be rapidly lifting along the Mission
      fault. This rapid uplift of the Briones sandstone creates
      over-steepened slopes with an abundant supply of fractured
      blocky rock, available to cascade over 1,000 feet
      downslope. . . ."  Fascinatingly the Mission fault passes right
      near the summit, creates visible offsets along Aliso Creek, and
      transmits slip between the Calaveras and Hayward Faults.  </li>

      <li>So many folks now have web pages describing their own
      Mission Peak hikes that I don't have the energy to link to all
      of them.  Here are some of my favorites: <a
      href="http://www.gulker.com/gulker/images/ebay/panorama.html">
      Chris Gulker's panorama photo</a>; particularly artistic photos
      by <a href= "http://www.bealecorner.net/mpeak/">John Beale</a>;
      a blog with <a
      href="http://tommangan.net/archives/cat_hiking_mission_peak.html">Mission
      Peak hike entries</a> </li>

</ul>

    <ul>
      <li>View a <a href=
      "http://terraserver.microsoft.com/image.aspx?t=1&amp;s=11&amp;x=1496&amp;y=10380&amp;z=10&amp;w=1">
        satellite image of the Mission Peak summit</a> using the
        Microsoft's terraserver site. The summit is at center-right
        while the Peak and Horse Heaven Trails are clearly seen on
        the left. The Eagle Trail is at right. The McClure Ranch
        home is at the bottom center. Mysteriously the image is
        labeled "San Jose, California." (What did you expect from
        Microsoft?) Thanks to Jerry Andrews for the suggestion to
        include this link.

     <li>What's the Mission Peak weather right now? Find out using
      your choice of webcams: from <a href=
      "http://pages.sbcglobal.net/amy.brooks/sequoia/">Newark</a> (I
      would guess) or from the <a href=
      "http://sternerson.com/webcam/">Warm Springs</a> section of
      Fremont or <a href="http://flymission.com/mission/">Mission
      Ridge webcam</a>from the mountain itself.</li>

      <li>Yahoo has a <a
      href="http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2733670-mission_peak_san_francisco-i">Mission
      Peak webpage</a> that seems to indicate that Mission Peak is in
      San Francisco.  Fascinatingly we learn that Mission Peak's
      street address is 43600 Mission Blvd.  I never would have
      thought to ask.  </li>

      <a href="/wolfgang/">Wolfgang</a> did most of the work,
      including lugging the differential DGPS receiver with its
      lead-acid battery all the way up to the summit several times.
