    <p>
      <a id="bilayersec" name="bilayersec">&nbsp;</a> One puzzling
      aspect of the interlayer exchange coupling in the Fe/Si
      system has been the dependence of its strength on the number
      of bilayers in the multilayer. This trend is illustrated in
      <a href="fig11.html">Figure 11</a>, where magnetization
      curves for (Fe40&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)xN multilayers with 2, 12
      and 25 repeats are displayed. (The 2-repeat multilayer is
      just an Fe/Si/Fe trilayer.) Although the trilayer has
      magnetic properties like bulk Fe, the 25-repeat multilayer
      data has a magnetization curve similar to the 40-repeat
      multilayer data shown above. The magnetization curve for the
      12-repeat multilayer falls in between that for the thicker
      and thinner films. Evidence for AF coupling which is stronger
      near the top of an Fe/Si multilayer than near the substrate
      has previously been described by Fullerton <em>et
      al.</em>[44] Presumably the increase of coupling with
      bilayer-number is a manifestation of the same phenomenon. The
      interlayer coupling in Co/Cu multilayers also increases with
      the number of bilayer periods up to about 25 bilayers.[45]
    </p>
    <p>
      One would not expect interlayer coupling that is
      quantum-mechanical in nature to be affected much by total
      film thickness. The unusual thickness dependence therefore
      raises the question of whether there is quantum-mechanical
      coupling at all, or whether some other mechanism might
      determine the shape of the magnetization curves. Disordered
      magnetic materials such as small amorphous Fe particles can
      have low remanence and high saturation fields without any
      layering at all. The magnetization curves of these Fe
      particles are in fact quite similar to those of the Fe/Si
      multilayers.[46] This resemblance might lead to speculation
      that the topmost Fe layers in Fe/Si multilayers are
      discontinuous and that the magnetic properties are dominated
      by particle shape. However, the existence of half-order peaks
      in polarized neutron reflectometry measurements in the
      IBS-grown Fe/Si multilayers[26] and the magnetron-sputtered
      multilayers[44] gives unambiguous evidence that the magnetic
      properties are due to magnetic order rather than structural
      disorder. In addition, TEM pictures such as Figure 6 show
      that the Fe layers are continuous in films with both high and
      low saturation fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      How then does the number of bilayer periods influence the AF
      coupling strength? It has been suggested that the difference
      between thin and thick multilayers grown at nominal RT is
      that the substrates of thick multilayers have time to rise to
      a higher temperature (about +60&deg;C for our system) during
      the longer growth.[36] This idea seems reasonable in light of
      the larger coupling in samples grown on heated substrates as
      described above. In order to investigate this idea, a
      (Fe100&Aring;/Si14&Aring;/Fe100&Aring;) film was grown on
      glass at +200&deg;C. The magnetization curve for this film is
      shown in <a href="fig12.html">Figure 12</a>. Also shown in
      this figure are data for a
      (Fe100&Aring;/Si14&Aring;/Fe100&Aring;) trilayer deposited at
      nominal RT and for a (Fe100&Aring;/Si14&Aring;/Fe100&Aring;)
      trilayer deposited at +200&deg;C, both grown on a
      500&Aring;-thick a-Si buffer. The trilayer deposited directly
      on glass at elevated temperature has only slightly less
      remanence and higher saturation field than the trilayer grown
      at RT whose data are shown in <a href="fig11.html">Figure
      11</a>. This result implies that it is not substrate
      temperature alone which causes bilayer-number effects. The
      magnetization curves of the trilayers grown on buffer layers,
      on the other hand, look much more like typical t
      <sub>Fe</sub> = 40&Aring; 40-repeat multilayer results. An
      epitaxial (Fe100&Aring;/Si14&Aring;/Fe100&Aring;) trilayer
      grown directly on an MgO(001) at +200&deg;C substrate also
      has strong AF coupling (data not shown). Undoubtedly the
      strong AF coupling of the trilayer grown directly on the MgO
      is due the superior surface quality of the single-crystal
      substrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The take-away lesson from all of these results is that
      substrate roughness is probably responsible for the reduced
      interlayer coupling in (Fe40&Aring;/Si14&Aring;) multilayers
      with a low number of bilayers. Conformal growth may propagate
      this roughness up from the substrate into the multilayer.
      Parkin et al. have found that the interlayer coupling in
      MBE-grown Co/Cu multilayers is very sensitive to the
      substrate and the buffer layer type, perhaps due to pinholes
      through the Cu layers.[47] Presumably thin Fe layers grown
      directly on glass are so wavy that pinhole and magnetostatic
      coupling dominate the interlayer interactions for the first
      few bilayer periods. Recent calculations show that
      magnetostatic effects associated with propagating roughness
      can give interlayer ferromagnetic coupling of the same order
      of magnitude as the coupling derived from quantum-well
      effects.[38] Ongoing polarized neutron reflectivity
      experiments may give more information on the variation of the
      coupling with position in the thicker multilayers.[26]
