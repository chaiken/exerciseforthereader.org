      <a id="thicksec" name="thicksec">&nbsp;</a> Forty- and
      fifty-repeat multilayers have been grown with t<sub>Fe</sub>
      = 14, 20, 30, 40, and 50&Aring; and t <sub>Si</sub> = 14 and
      20&Aring;. Magnetization curves for 50-repeat
      (Fe30&Aring;/Si20&Aring;) and (Fe30&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)
      multilayers grown on glass at nominal RT (about +60&deg;C)
      are shown in <a href="fig2.html">Figure 2</a>. On the y-axis
      of this plot is the magnetic moment of the multilayer
      normalized to the moment of an equivalent volume of bulk Fe.
      The magnetization curve of the (30/20) multilayer looks much
      like that of an Fe film, while the magnetization curve of the
      (30/14) multilayer shows the high saturation field and low
      remanence which characterize AF interlayer coupling. At its
      saturation field the magnetization of the (30/14) multilayer
      is about the same as for the (30/20) multilayer. Both of
      these films have moments only about half as large as an
      equivalent volume of bulk Fe. Our observation of AF coupling
      for Si thicknesses between 10 and 20&Aring; and the
      disappearance of coupling for Si thicker than 20&Aring;
      confirm previous observations on magnetron-sputtered
      films.[5]
    </p>
    <p>
      X-ray diffraction spectra for these multilayers are shown in
      Figures 3 and 5. <a href="fig3.html">Figure 3</a> shows the
      small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) data with peaks at angles
    </p>
    <p>
      n<sup>2</sup> lambda<sup>2</sup> = 4 Lambda<sup>2</sup>
      sin<sup>2</sup>theta + 2 delta
    </p>
    <p>
      where lambda is the x-ray wavelength, Lambda ==
      t<sub>Fe</sub> + t<sub>Si</sub> is the multilayer bilayer
      period and delta is the index of refraction for x-rays.[28]
      This grazing incidence data gives information about the
      quality of the multilayer interfaces. <a href=
      "fig3.html">Figure 3</a> shows four low-angle peaks for both
      films, indicating a reasonably strong composition modulation
      along the growth direction. (The higher frequency
      oscillations between 1&deg; and 4&deg; are finite-thickness
      fringes from the Ge cap layer.) The most notable difference
      between the two spectra is that the multilayer peaks are
      broader for the AF-coupled t <sub>Si</sub> = 14&Aring; film,
      indicating more fluctuations in bilayer period and probably
      more interface roughness. Using the spacing between peak
      positions to eliminate the unknown delta from Eqn. <a href=
      "node4.html#lowbragg">1</a> gives values of the bilayer
      period lambda for the two films. For the multilayer with
      nominal layering of (Fe30&Aring;/Si20&Aring;)x50, the derived
      value for lambda is (41.82 &plusmn; 0.07)&Aring;, while for
      the (Fe30&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)x50 film lambda = (38.10
      &plusmn; 0.04)&Aring;. lambda is 8.2&Aring; shorter than the
      nominal value for the t <sub>Si</sub> = 20&Aring; film, and
      5.9&Aring; shorter than nominal for the t <sub>Si</sub> =
      14&Aring; film. Although some of the discrepancy between the
      nominal and observed bilayer period may be due to calibration
      inaccuracies, most is undoubtedly due to intermixing of the
      Fe and Si layers, in keeping with observations in the other
      metal/Si multilayers.[10,14] Throughout this paper we will
      continue for convenience to refer to the films in terms of
      their nominal layer thicknesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparison of the magnetization data to the x-ray data can
      give some further insight into the question of intermixing.
      Because of the presumed interdiffusion of the Fe and Si
      layers, the magnetic moment of the Fe layers is also reduced
      from the nominal value. The missing magnetic moment can be
      expressed as an equivalent thickness of Fe. <a href=
      "fig4.html">Figure 4</a> shows a plot of missing moment in
      units of &Aring; ngstroms of Fe versus missing bilayer period
      determined from multilayer peak positions in SAXS for films
      grown at room temperature (RT). The plot shows that while the
      diffusion-induced reduction in bilayer period varies between
      1 and 8&Aring;, the missing Fe moment per bilayer (for both
      interfaces) is consistently between 10 and 12&Aring;. The one
      outlier in <a href="fig4.html">Figure 4</a> is for a film
      which had t <sub>Fe</sub> = 20&Aring;, the thinnest Fe for
      which we have ever observed interlayer coupling. Other groups
      have previously observed a moment reduction of 12-14&Aring;
      per bilayer in polarized neutron reflectivity measurements on
      uncoupled Fe/Si multilayers with thick Si layers.[29,30]
    </p>
    <p>
      The disparity between the magnetic moment reduction and the
      bilayer period reduction numbers may at first appear to be
      puzzling. This disparity occurs because the moment and
      bilayer period are affected by different aspects of the
      structure. In calculating the moment reduction in &Aring; the
      assumption has been made that the Fe layer has the
      magnetization of bulk Fe. This is equivalent to assuming that
      there is no Si in the Fe layer, which is undoubtedly false.
      In calculating the missing bilayer period, the assumption has
      also been made that the spacer layer is pure Si, also clearly
      false. The fact that the missing magnetic moment is almost
      constant irrespective of the reduction in bilayer period
      suggests that the spacer layer is non-magnetic independent of
      Si thickness. The lack of variation of the missing moment is
      then explained by the diffusion of a constant number of iron
      atoms into the silicon layer, irrespective of its thickness.
      The wide variation of the measured bilayer period is most
      likely related to the varying orientation and crystallinity
      of the spacer layer, neither of which affects the magnetic
      moment if the spacer itself is non-magnetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="fig5.html">Figure 5</a> shows the high-angle x-ray
      spectra where peak positions give information about the
      orientation and crystallinity of the films. The intense peak
      near 70&deg; in this plot is due to the Si substrate.
      Included are data for an (Fe40&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)x40
      antiferromagnetically coupled multilayer and for an
      (Fe30&Aring;/Si20&Aring;)x40 uncoupled multilayer, both grown
      on oxidized Si(001) at RT. The peaks for the (40/14) film are
      narrower than for the (30/20). The Scherrer formula gives
      78&Aring; or about two bilayer periods for the coherence
      length of the (40/14) film and 34&Aring; or about one bilayer
      period for the coherence length of the (30/20) film.
      Coherence lengths in IBS-sputtered antiferromagnetically
      coupled films are often as long as 200&Aring;. Fullerton
      <em>et al.</em> have inferred that the spacer layer in
      thin-Si Fe/Si multilayers must be crystalline based on their
      observation of coherence lengths longer than a bilayer
      period.[5] In keeping with its superior crystallinity, the
      (40/14) multilayer has one superlattice satellite on the
      low-angle side of the Fe(002) peak. Typically only one
      satellite on the low-angle side of the Fe (011) or (002)
      x-ray peak is observed for polycrystalline multilayers grown
      on glass, in agreement with observations by Foiles et al.[31]
    </p>
    <p>
      The thin-Si multilayers which have AF coupling usually show a
      mixed [001] and [011] orientation when grown on glass
      substrates at RT. Occasionally t <sub>Si</sub> = 14&Aring;
      films with a pure (011) orientation are obtained at RT. The
      variation in texture may be due to changes in film stress
      under slightly different deposition conditions. Stress
      induced during deposition has been postulated to explain the
      mixed Mo texture found in Mo/Ge multilayers.[3] In contrast
      to the thin-Si case, the thicker-Si Fe/Si multilayers which
      do not show interlayer coupling always have a pure (011)
      texture. Since the (011) plane is close-packed for the bcc
      crystal structure, one would expect the (011) orientation to
      be energetically favored for the Fe in a multilayer with
      amorphous Si. Films grown at nominal RT on glass or oxidized
      Si substrates typically had rocking curves about 10&deg; wide
      indicating a moderate amount of orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been used to
      further investigate the morphology of the films. TEM
      cross-sectional images of an (Fe30&Aring;/Si20&Aring;)x50
      multilayer and an (Fe40&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)x50 multilayer
      grown during the same deposition run are shown in Figures 6a
      and 6b, respectively. The most salient features of the
      (30/20) multilayer are the long lateral continuity of the
      layers and the smoothness of the interfaces. Since there is
      no interlayer coherence in the (30/20) film, the crystalline
      grains have a high aspect ratio. The (40/14) multilayer also
      has long, continuous layer planes but has rougher interfaces,
      consistent with the SAXS data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transmission electron selected-area diffraction patterns for
      the (30/20) and (40/14) films are shown in parts c and d of
      Figure 6. The (30/20) films shows only a Fe(011) ring,
      consistent with the high-angle x-ray diffraction scans. The
      (40/14) film, on the other hand, displays spots corresponding
      to the (011) and (002) reflections seen using x-rays. The
      presence of spots rather than rings in the (40/14) image
      implies the presence of large, oriented crystallites in the
      film. Most interestingly, the (40/14) image includes a faint
      spot near what would be the Fe(001) position were the Fe(001)
      peak not forbidden by symmetry in the bcc crystal structure.
      The (001) peak is allowed in the B2 and DO <sub>3</sub>
      crystal structures. The B2 structure is found in the
      equilibrium phase diagram only at 10-22% Si range of
      composition,[32] but workers at ETH have grown this crystal
      structure throughout the range of composition on Si
      substrates using MBE.[33] The DO<sub>3</sub> phase found in
      the equilibrium phase diagram is Fe<sub>3</sub>Si, which is
      ferromagnetic.[32] Clearly a ferromagnetic spacer phase is
      not consistent with the observation of antiferromagnetic
      interlayer coupling, although a non-stoichiometric
      DO<sub>3</sub>-structure phase might have different magnetic
      order. The B2 and epsilon iron silicide phases have both been
      previously suggested as possible candidates for the spacer
      layer in AF-coupled Fe/Si multilayers.[5,31,34] The position
      of the (001) TEM spots is not consistent with the
      <strong>d</strong>-spacings of the epsilon phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the powder-diffraction files for the B2 and
      DO<sub>3</sub> structures, only the (111) peak of the
      fcc-family DO<sub>3</sub> does not coincide with a B2 peak.
      The (111) peak would be expected to be very weak in the
      diffraction patterns formed from cross-sectional specimens of
      the film. The reason is that a small number of grains
      contributes to the cross-sectional image, and the probability
      of sampling a grain with its (111) planes in the observable
      direction is small because of the random in-plane
      orientation. Future work will include electron diffraction
      studies of a (40/14) specimen prepared in the plan-view
      geometry, where the number of grains which are sampled is
      considerably larger and the odds of observing the fcc (111)
      peak are improved.
    </p>
    <p>
      High-resolution TEM images of the (30/20) and (40/14)
      multilayers are displayed in Figure 7. The (30/20) film is
      shown in 7a to have a crystalline Fe layer and amorphous
      spacer layer, similar to the morphology seen before in
      Mo/Si[13,14] and Co/Si multilayers.[11] The (40/14)
      multilayer in Fig. 7b on the other hand is made up entirely
      of crystalline layers. The coherence between the Fe and
      silicide spacer is clearly evidenced by the continuity of
      atomic layer planes from the Fe layer into the spacer. Some
      crystallites in the (40/14) film extend all the way from the
      substrate to the surface of the film. The small coherence
      lengths observed in x-ray diffraction data for the uncoupled
      thicker-Si films are explained by the presence of the
      amorphous layers. The lack of crystallinity in the spacer
      layer of t <sub>Si</sub> = 20&Aring; films is presumably due
      to insufficient time for full interdiffusion and ordering in
      the thicker layers. A kinetic mechanism for the lack of
      crystallization is supported by experiments which show that
      intentional placement of Fe in the Si layer allows thicker
      spacer layers to crystallize.[25,35]
    </p>
    <p>
      Another striking feature of the image in Figure 7b is the
      periodic modulation that occurs in the silicide spacer layer.
      The modulation originates from scattering by inequivalent
      planes of atoms. Simulation of this image using a
      multiple-scattering computer calculation may be helpful in
      positively identifying the crystal structure of the spacer
      layer phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dark-field images of the (40/14) multilayer can help answer
      questions about the texture of the film as well. Figure 8a
      shows the same bright-field image as in Figure 6b. Dark-field
      images were formed using (001), (002) and (011) spots from
      the diffraction pattern shown in Figure 6d. The resulting
      micrographs are shown in Figures 8b, c, and d respectively.
      Panels a and b of this figure show the same region of the
      (40/14) multilayer. The brightness of the spacer layers in
      this dark-field image demonstrates that the (001) reflection
      does indeed come from the spacer layer and is not the
      forbidden (001) spot of bcc Fe. Figures 8c and d also show
      the same region (although a different region than panels a
      and b). The bright areas in these two images are the
      complement of one another; where one is bright, the other is
      dark and vice versa. The dark-field images in panels c and d
      of Figure 8 demonstrate convincingly that the orientation of
      the film evolves from predominantly (011) to predominantly
      (002) as the thickness increases. The reason for the change
      in orientation with film thickness is not obvious; it may be
      related to the bilayer-period-number dependence discussed in
      Section <a href="node6.html#bilayersec">iii C</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of varying the Fe thickness has also been studied.
      Magnetic properties for films with 20&Aring; &lt;= t
      <sub>Fe</sub> &lt;= 50&Aring; are found to change only
      slightly in keeping with the expected inverse proportionality
      of the saturation field with t <sub>Fe</sub>.[6] SAXS peaks
      tend to broaden and even split with increasing Fe thickness,
      indicating increased disorder in the layering. The splitting
      of these peaks may indicate different bilayer periods in
      areas of the film with the (011) and (001) textures. When the
      Fe is made less than 20&Aring; thick, the Fe high-angle
      diffraction peaks disappear and so does the AF coupling. The
      disappearance of crystalline Fe peaks near t <sub>Fe</sub> =
      20&Aring; is consistent with previous results on evaporated
      Fe/Si multilayers.[29] Thus poor crystallinity of the Fe
      layers appears to suppress the interlayer coupling even when
      the Si thickness is favorable. The lack of AF coupling in
      films with poorly crystalline Fe may be related to the lack
      of a template for the crystalline iron silicide spacer to
      grow on.
