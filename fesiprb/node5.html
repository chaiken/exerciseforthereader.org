      <a id="tempsec" name="tempsec">&nbsp;</a> Depositing the
      multilayers at different substrate temperatures is an obvious
      way of influencing the composition and crystallinity of the
      spacer layer phase in the Fe/Si multilayers. Fullerton has
      suggested that the interlayer of Fe/Si multilayers is
      improved by high-temperature growth.[36] We have grown films
      on glass substrates at various temperatures between -150 and
      +200&deg;C. The effect of substrate temperature on the
      interlayer coupling of the films is illustrated in <a href=
      "fig9.html">Figure 9</a>, where magnetization curves for
      three (Fe40&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)x40 multilayers grown at
      -150&deg;C, +60&deg;C (nominal RT) and +200&deg;C are shown.
      The data show that as the substrate temperature increases the
      saturation field increases indicating larger AF coupling. The
      saturation magnetization also decreases, suggesting a larger
      degree of interdiffusion in the films grown at higher
      temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suspicion that more interdiffusion occurs at higher
      substrate temperatures is confirmed by examination of the
      SAXS spectra for the three films, shown in <a href=
      "fig10.html">Figure 10</a>. The film grown at reduced
      temperature has 7 peaks while the film grown at nominal RT
      has 5 and the film grown at +200&deg;C has only 4.
      Quantitative modelling of low-angle x-ray data has shown that
      the suppression of higher-order peaks may be due to either
      interdiffusion or cumulative roughness.[28,37] Certainly
      larger cumulative roughness could also occur at higher growth
      temperatures, but one would expect very rough growth to
      suppress AF coupling due to an increased number of pinholes
      and larger magnetostatic interlayer coupling.[38] Since
      higher growth temperatures seem to enhance rather than
      suppress the coupling, it seems more likely that high
      substrate temperatures are promoting interdiffusion rather
      than roughness. Studies of Mo/Si multilayers showed that a
      growth temperature of 150&deg;C gives maximum SAXS
      reflectivity, which the authors attribute to greater
      interface smoothness than for RT deposition.[39] Smaller
      bilayer periods in multilayers grown at higher temperatures
      support the claim of increased interdiffusion. Fitting Eqn.
      <a href="node4.html#lowbragg">1</a> to peak positions from <a
      href="fig10.html">Figure 10</a> gives lambda = 52.7, 49.3,
      and 43.8 &Aring;\ respectively for the -150&deg;, +60&deg;,
      and +200&deg; multilayers versus the nominal value of
      54&Aring;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Higher substrate temperatures may also promote ordering of
      the Fe and Si atoms in the crystalline spacer layer. In the
      fully ordered B2 phase, the Fe and Si atoms sit on different
      simple cubic sublattices. The sublattice order can occur
      irrespective of whether or not the Fe to Si ratio is 1:1. It
      is interesting to speculate whether the AF coupling is
      dependent on the degree of ordering in the spacer layer. An
      ordering-dependent coupling seems plausible in light of the
      Fermi-surface theories of coupling in metal/metal
      multilayers.[40,41] A well-ordered B2 or DO <sub>3</sub>
      phase would have more well-defined Fermi surface features
      than a random solid solution. Unfortunately the (001)
      silicide peak has only been observed by TEM, making
      experimental attempts to address this issue difficult.
      Further studies with x-ray diffraction and soft x-ray
      fluorescence are underway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crystallinity of the films also varies with growth
      temperature. Surprisingly, films grown at both low and high
      temperatures on glass substrates always have only the (011)
      texture, while films grown at nominal RT often have mixed
      (001) and (011) textures. The multilayers deposited on heated
      and cooled substrates do differ greatly in that those grown
      at low temperature have amorphous spacer layers, while those
      grown at high temperatures have long crystalline coherence
      lengths. The reasons for the strange temperature dependence
      of growth texture are not understood, although one presumes
      that they have to do with the kinetics of growth. It is not
      clear why the (001) texture should appear at all, although it
      has also been seen in Mo/Ge multilayers.[3] An oscillatory
      dependence of film texture on spacer layer thickness and
      deposition conditions has been reported for NiFe/Cu
      multilayers grown by IBS.[42] The (001) texture has not been
      reported in polycrystalline magnetron-sputtered Fe/Si
      multilayers, and may be due to some peculiarity of IBS
      growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A logical extension to the growth temperature studies is to
      try annealing the Fe/Si multilayers grown at lower substrate
      temperatures to see if their properties evolve towards those
      of the multilayers grown at higher temperatures. As far as
      the magnetic properties are concerned, the answer is ``no.''
      Annealing the uncoupled RT-grown (Fe30&Aring;/Si20&Aring;)x40
      and low-temperature-grown (Fe40&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)x40
      multilayers at +200&deg;C for two hours had almost no effect
      on their magnetic properties beyond a slight magnetic moment
      reduction. A subsequent 300&deg;C anneal for two hours once
      more produced a moment reduction and a decrease in coercive
      field in the uncoupled multilayers. A very low coercive field
      for annealed Fe/Si films is not surprising given the
      well-known softness of Fe-Si alloys. A 300&deg;C anneal even
      eliminated the interlayer exchange coupling of a RT-grown
      (Fe40&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)x50 film used as a control. For this
      (40/14) multilayer, the 300&deg;C anneal caused the SAXS
      peaks to narrow and reduced their number from 5 to 4. At the
      same time the bilayer period decreased from 49.4&Aring; to
      46.0&Aring;. High-angle x-rays spectra (not shown) indicated
      that the Fe lattice constant slightly decreased, which is
      consistent with increased diffusion of Si in the Fe
      layer.[31] These x-ray and magnetization results imply that
      annealing primarily promotes interdiffusion of the Fe and
      silicide layers. With sufficient interdiffusion the spacer
      layer may become ferromagnetic, which would explain the
      suppression of antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling. These
      Fe/Si multilayers show less thermal stability than Mo/Si
      multilayers with comparable layer thicknesses, which do not
      show changes in SAXS spectra until 400&deg;C.[39] There was
      no sign of the solid-state amorphization previously observed
      in Fe/Si multilayers with thicker layers.[43]
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever process occurs during annealing, it does not enhance
      the interlayer coupling the way that +200&deg;C growth does.
      This is hardly surprising given that annealing will tend to
      drive the multilayer towards its equilibrium state,
      presumably a mixture of different iron silicide phases. There
      is no reason to think that the crystalline
      Fe/Fe<sub>x</sub>Si<sub>1-x</sub> multilayer should be an
      intermediate phase during the annealing. In the future the
      kinetics of Fe/Si multilayer growth at different substrate
      temperatures will be investigated further by employing an
      ion-assist gun to improve atomic surface mobility.
