    <p>
      Fe and Si appear to be the only known
      transition-metal/semiconductor combination in which the two
      elements interdiffuse to form a crystalline spacer layer with
      coherent interfaces. The reasons why this unusual morphology
      occurs in the Fe/Si system are unknown but likely involve a
      high rate of Fe diffusion into a-Si and a low heat of
      crystallization of the iron silicide compound. A detailed
      discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of this paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three different crystal structures have been proposed for the
      crystalline spacer layer of the Fe/Si multilayers. The
      epsilon phase can be eliminated on the basis of the electron
      diffraction patterns and TEM dark field images presented
      here. The B2 and DO<sub>3</sub> crystal structures are better
      lattice-matched to Fe than epsilon-FeSi or alpha- and
      beta-FeSi<sub>2</sub>. The lattice constant of the B2 phase
      was reported by M&auml;der and coworkers to be 2.77&Aring;,
      only 3.1% different from Fe.[51] The lattice constant of the
      epsilon phase is 4.46&Aring;,[51] which matches the Fe(110)
      plane only in the energetically unfavorable (210)
      direction.[35]
    </p>
    <p>
      Recent conversion-electron M&ouml;ssbauer data are
      interpreted in support of the B2 crystal structure, although
      the possibility of the DO<sub>3</sub> phase was not
      considered in that study.[34] It is plausible that the B2 or
      DO<sub>3</sub> structures form in rapid, far-from-equilibrium
      growth conditions because of their small unit cells. Since
      silicon deposited at low substrate temperatures is amorphous,
      the most likely scenario is the following. Silicon deposited
      on a crystalline Fe layer goes down amorphous and diffuses
      only slightly into the Fe. Subsequently deposited Fe atoms
      diffuse rapidly into the amorphous Si, analogous to what
      happens during the growth of Mo/Si multilayers.[13,14] During
      the diffusion of Fe into Si, crystallization of the silicide
      occurs, possibly driven by the heat of mixing or by the
      kinetic energy of the incident Fe atoms. Growth of the
      crystalline phase may proceed upward from the lattice-matched
      Fe template, or downward from the atomically bombarded film
      surface. If the growth of the crystalline silicide phase
      proceeds downward from the film surface, one might expect to
      see some crystalline silicide in the high-resolution TEM
      image for the t <sub>Si</sub> = 20&Aring; film (Figure 7b).
      The lack of any evidence for crystalline silicide in this
      image suggest that the crystallization proceeds upward from
      the iron/silicide interface, not downward from the film
      surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to determine how realistic this model for
      growth of the crystalline silicide is since the Fe/Fe-Si and
      Si-Fe/Fe interfaces appear identical in Figure 7b. In
      contrast, the Mo/Si and Si/Mo interfaces in Mo/Si multilayers
      appear quite different from one another.[13,14] In the Mo/Si
      multilayers, an amorphous MoSi<sub>2</sub> region appears
      which is thicker at the Mo/Si interface than at the Si/Mo
      interface. Detailed TEM studies of multilayers with t
      <sub>Si</sub> larger than 20&Aring; may help to answer
      whether amorphous silicides can occur in IBS-grown Fe/Si
      multilayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the B2 phase lattice constant reported by the
      Z&uuml;rich group,[51] we can estimate the expected bilayer
      period of a nominal Fe/Si multilayer in which Fe atoms
      diffuse into the Si layer up to a 1:1 stoichiometry. The
      spacing between the Fe and Fe <sub>x</sub>Si <sub>1-x</sub>
      layers is taken as the average of the interplanar spacings of
      the two materials. The result of this rough calculation is
      that an (Fe40&Aring;/Si14&Aring;) multilayer which
      interdiffuses up to the 1:1 stoichiometry should form a
      (Fe33.2&Aring;/FeSi16.3&Aring;) multilayer with a bilayer
      period of 49.4&Aring;. The missing bilayer period predicted
      from this model is 4.6&Aring;, in the middle of values on the
      x-axis of <a href="fig4.html">Figure 4</a>. One can also
      calculate the expected magnetic moment reduction assuming
      that Fe atoms in the silicide layer have no moment and those
      in the Fe layer have their full moment. Under this assumption
      a calculation predicts 8.2&Aring; of missing Fe moment,
      slightly lower than indicated in <a href="fig4.html">Figure
      4</a>. This calculation neglects the possibility that some Fe
      atoms in the Fe layer with Si near neighbors may have reduced
      magnetic moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the discussion above the possibility has not been
      mentioned that the missing bilayer period and magnetic moment
      are due to an inaccurate thickness calibration. This
      explanation is contradicted by magnetization and x-ray
      diffraction measurements on Fe/Ge multilayers, where measured
      magnetic moments and bilayer periods are in much closer
      agreement with nominal values than for Fe/Si.[50] The
      improved agreement in the case of Fe/Ge multilayers suggests
      that interdiffusion is less important in multilayers with Ge
      spacer layers than in multilayers with Si spacers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main point is that the formation of the B2 silicide does
      qualitatively explain the bilayer period reduction observed
      in the Fe/Si multilayers. The underlying reason for the
      bilayer period reduction is that the silicide which forms is
      denser than both Fe and Si. This situation is similar to that
      observed in other metal/Si multilayers[10,14] except that in
      the other multilayers the silicide remains amorphous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confirmation that the spacer layer phase has the B2 or DO
      <sub>3</sub> structure is important for understanding the
      coupling mechanism in these compounds. Both the B2 and DO
      <sub>3</sub> phases are known to be metallic for some ranges
      of composition.[15,16] Thus the present results and those of
      other workers[5,34] suggest that Fe/Si is really a
      metal/metal multilayer. The origin of the interlayer coupling
      is then likely to be described by the same theories as
      describe coupling in Co/Cu and Fe/Cr multilayers.[40,41]
      Fe/Si multilayers may therefore not be a good test case for
      theories which model interlayer exchange coupling across
      insulators.[8,9]
    </p>
    <p>
      In the discussion above the possibility has been neglected
      that the amorphous spacer layer in the thick-Si films may
      also be metallic. If both the thick amorphous spacers and the
      thin crystalline spacers are metallic silicides, then it must
      be the crystallinity that is the essential feature for the
      existence of AF interlayer coupling. Up to now there have
      been no reports of AF coupling across amorphous metallic
      spacer layers. Toscano et al. have reported AF coupling
      across amorphous silicon spacer layers.[4] These Fe/a-Si/Fe
      trilayers were prepared at low temperature so as to suppress
      interdiffusion.[4] The character of AF coupling in the a-Si
      spacer trilayers is likely quite different than in the
      multilayers described in this study, where substrate heating
      increases the strength of coupling.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment there is no direct evidence regarding the
      metallic or insulating nature of the amorphous spacer layers
      found in the (Fe30&Aring;/Si20&Aring;) multilayers.
      Temperature-dependent current-in-plane resistivity
      measurements suggest that both crystalline and amorphous
      spacer layers in Fe/Si multilayers are poorly conducting.[50]
      Fe<sub>70</sub>Si<sub>30</sub> and
      Fe<sub>65</sub>Si<sub>35</sub> amorphous alloys have a
      temperature-independent resistivity, suggesting non-metallic
      behavior.[52] Overall the evidence suggests that the
      amorphous spacer layers in (Fe30&Aring;/Si20&Aring;)
      multilayers are not metallic, but spectroscopic measurements
      like soft x-ray fluorescence[24] are needed for confirmation.
      The interesting question as to whether there can be AF
      interlayer coupling across an amorphous metal spacer layer
      must then be left for another study.
