      Magnetization curves for (Fe30&Aring;/Si20&Aring;)x50 and
      (Fe30&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)x50 multilayers grown on glass
      substrates at nominal RT during the same deposition run.
      Plotted on the y-axis is the observed magnetization of the
      films divided through by the calculated magnetization of an
      equivalent thickness of bulk Fe. The
      (Fe30&Aring;/Si20&Aring;)x50 multilayer has soft magnetic
      properties much like bulk Fe, while the
      (Fe30&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)x50 multilayer exhibits AF
      interlayer coupling.<br />

      diffraction spectra at small-angle for the same films whose
      magnetization curves are shown above. Broader peaks show that
      there is more disorder in layering for the AF-coupled film
      with t <sub>Si</sub> = 14&Aring;. Using Equation 1, these
      data give bilayer periods lambda = 41.82&Aring; for the
      nominal (Fe30&Aring;/20&Aring;)x50 film and lambda =

      textures. The film labelled ``LN'' was grown on a LN-cooled
      substrate; all others were grown at nominal RT. All
      multilayers have 40 or 50 repeats and were grown on either
      glass or oxidized Si substrates.<br />

      High-angle spectra for two Fe/Si multilayers showing the Fe
      (011) and (002) peaks. The t <sub>Si</sub> = 20&Aring; film
      is predominantly (011)-textured, while the AF-coupled film
      with t <sub>Si</sub> = 14 &Aring; has mixed (011) and (001)
      textures. No x-ray diffraction peaks which could be indexed
      to crystalline silicon or silicide spacer layer phases have
      been observed in any Fe/Si multilayer. A superlattice
      satellite just below the Fe(002) peak is labelled
      ``-1.''<br />

       <strong>Figure 6:</strong> Cross-sectional TEM images (a and
      b) and selected area diffraction patterns (c and d) for the
      same (Fe30&Aring;/Si20&Aring;)x50 multilayer and a
      (Fe40&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)x50 multilayer grown that shows
      strong AF coupling. a) and b) show that the Fe/Si multilayers
      have layers which are continuous for large lateral distances.
      There is no sign of propagating roughness or columnar growth.
      c) The (30/20) multilayer shows only an Fe(011) ring. d) The
      (40/14) film shows (011) and (002) spots plus a faint spot at
      the (001) position (indicated by an arrow).[No image; takes
      up too much space and is too big to load!]<br />

       <strong>Figure 7:</strong> High-resolution TEM images of the
      same films whose low-resolution images are shown above. a)
      (Fe30&Aring;/Si20&Aring;)x50 multilayer image showing
      amorphous silicide layers between polycrystalline Fe layers.
      b) (Fe40&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)x50 multilayer image showing
      crystalline coherence between the polycrystalline Fe layers
      and iron silicide spacer layers. There is no amorphous layer
      present. [No image; takes up too much space and is too big to
      load!]<br />

       <strong>Figure 8:</strong> a) The same bright field TEM
      micrograph of the (Fe40&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)x50 multilayer as
      is shown in Figure 6b. b) A dark-field image of the same
      region of the (40/14) multilayer. This dark-field image was
      formed using the (001) reflection. Comparison with the bright
      field image shows that the (001) reflection originates from
      the Si substrate and the spacer layers. c) and d) Dark-field
      images formed from (002) and (011) reflections. Image c)
      shows that planes with (002) orientation predominate near the
      film surface. Image d) shows that planes with (011)
      orientation predominate near the substrate. The film surface
      is on the top of all these images.[No image; takes up too
      much space and is too big to load!]<br />

       <strong><a href="fig9.html">Figure 9:</a></strong>
      Magnetization curves for three (Fe40&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)x40
      multilayers grown on glass substrates at -150&deg;, +60&deg;C
      and +200&deg;C. The increase of the saturation field with
      increasing substrate temperature indicates an increase in AF
      coupling. Note that the saturation magnetization also
      decreases slightly with increasing substrate
      temperature.<br />

      (Fe40&Aring;/Si14&Aring;)x40 multilayers grown on glass
      substrates at -150&deg;C, +60&deg;C and +200&deg;C. The
      disappearance of higher-order peaks at higher substrate
      temperatures is an indication of greater
      interdiffusion.<br />

      (Fe40&Aring;/Si14&Aring;) multilayers grown during the same
      deposition run at nominal RT on glass substrates. The
      2-repeat multilayer (really an Fe/Si/Fe trilayer) shows no
      signs of AF coupling. The 12-repeat multilayer appears to
      have a smaller coupling than the 25-repeat one.<br />

       <strong><a href="fig12.html">Figure 12:</a></strong>
      Magnetization curves of three (Fe/Si/Fe) trilayers. The open
      circles are data for an
      (Fe100&Aring;/Si14&Aring;/Fe100&Aring;) film grown directly
      on glass at +200&deg;C. The filled circles are data on a
      (Fe100&Aring;/Si14&Aring;/Fe100&Aring;) film grown at
      +200&deg;C on a 500&Aring;\ a-Si buffer layer on glass. The
      solid curve is for a (Fe100&Aring;/Si14&Aring;/Fe100&Aring;)
      film grown at nominal RT on a 500&Aring; a-Si buffer layer on
      glass. The coupling is stronger in the film grown at high
      temperature on a buffer than in either of the other two
      films.<br />
