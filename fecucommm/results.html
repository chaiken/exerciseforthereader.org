      Another way of obtaining unequal coercivities in two layers
      of a sandwich is simply to make them out of different
      ferromagnets. Previous workers employed this strategy with
      NiFe-Cu-Co sandwiches.[7] In the present case, Fe-Cu-Co
      structures have been grown on glass or Si substrates using
      electron-beam evaporation. Each sandwich was capped with a Cu
      protection layer about 30&Aring; thick. The specifics of the
      deposition and basic characterization have been discussed
      previously.[8] Under appropriate growth conditions, as
      detailed below, the Co films have a coercive field of about
      200 Oe, while the Fe films have a weakly growth-dependent
      coercive field of about 30 Oe. The B-H loop of a properly
      prepared Fe-Cu-Co sandwich is shown as the
      t<sub>Fe</sub>=40&Aring; curve in <a href="fig1.html">Figure
      1a)</a>. The identification of the higher coercivity part of
      the B-H loop with the Co film is supported by a
      Co-layer-thickness study, which showed that the moment
      associated with the higher-coercivity part of the loop
      increases linearly with Co thickness.[8]
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of the sequential switching of the two
      ferromagnetic layers, the magnetization curves of these
      structures display a plateau of nearly constant moment about
      150 Oe wide. In this plateau region, the moments of the Fe
      and Co films are macroscopically antialigned. The resistance
      of the structure is enhanced in the plateau region, as
      demonstrated by the t<sub>Fe</sub>=40&Aring; curve in <a
      href="fig1.html">Figure 1b)</a>. The enhanced resistance
      associated with the antialignment of the moments has been
      called the spin-valve effect.[5]
    </p>
    <p>
      The solid curves in <a href="fig1.html">Figures 1a) and
      1b)</a> show the corresponding data for a sample with a
      thinner Fe layer, 16&Aring; thick. <a href="fig1.html">Figure
      1a)</a> shows that reducing the thickness of the Fe layer has
      little effect on the magnetic properties of the Fe, but has
      the unexpected consequence of greatly reducing the coercivity
      of the Co layer. Previous studies of the effect of varying
      the Co layer thickness and growth temperature have shown that
      the coercivity of the Co layer is very sensitive to both
      parameters.[3,4,8] Nonetheless, it is surprising that the Fe
      layer thickness should impact the Co coercivity. Since one
      expects that the length scale of the grains in a
      polycrystalline film should be approximately the same as the
      layer thickness, this result may be an indication that the
      coercivity of the Co film may be strongly dependent on the
      grain size. Another possibility is that the Co growth may
      variously be fcc or hcp depending on the deposition
      conditions. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy studies
      are underway to investigate these hypotheses.

      Previous groups of investigators have observed
      antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling in Co-Cu and Fe-Cu
      superlattices.[9] The coupling in these superlattices has the
      form of an exponentially decaying sinusoid versus Cu
      thickness. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements of the
      Fe-Cu-Co sandwiches have been performed to look for signs of
      a similar interlayer coupling. No antiferromagnetic coupling
      is seen over a wide range of Cu thicknesses, although the
      possibility of ferromagnetic interlayer coupling cannot be
      ruled out. The lack of antiferromagnetic coupling in these
      samples is not understood, since some of the Cu layers fall
      in the thickness range where it has been found earlier.[9]
      For low Cu thicknesses only one resonance is observed, rather
      than the two distinct resonances that would be expected for
      completely decoupled Fe and Cu films. Even samples with
      plateaus in their magnetization curves sometimes have only a
      single FMR line. The observation of only one peak is
      suggestive of a small degree of coupling between the Fe and
      Co. Ferromagnetic interlayer coupling may be responsible for
      the square shape of the magnetic hysteresis loops observed
      for sandwiches with thick Fe and Co layers, but with
      t<sub>Cu</sub> &lt; 30&Aring;. On the other hand, since the
      Co coercivity is obviously very sensitive to the growth mode,
      interlayer coupling cannot be definitely identified as the
      cause.

      The magnetoresistance in the Fe-Cu-Co sandwiches has two
      components, the spin-valve part, which is unique to
      multilayers, and the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR),
      which is observed in both multilayers and single
      ferromagnetic films. The AMR is entirely responsible for the
      magnetoresistance of the t<sub>Fe</sub> = 16&Aring; sample
      since, as <a href="fig1.html">Figure 1a)</a> shows, there is
      no applied field region where the Fe and Co moments are
      antialigned, and thus no spin-valve effect. Because the AMR
      is typically about a tenth the size of the spin-valve MR in
      these samples, the magnetoresistance of the
      t<sub>Fe</sub>=16&Aring; sandwich is much smaller than that
      of the t<sub>Fe</sub>=40&Aring; sandwich. By measuring the
      angular dependence of the resistance at a large constant
      applied field, the two components of the MR can be separated
      out even for samples where both contribute.[5,6] The
      spin-valve MR and AMR thus obtained are shown in <a href=
      "fig2.html">Figure 2</a> for a series of Fe-Cu-Co sandwiches
      with varying Fe thickness. The AMR increases linearly with
      increasing Fe thickness, which is the straightforward
      consequence of the increasing fraction of ferromagnetic
      material in the sample.
    </p>

      The broad peak in the spin-valve MR versus Fe thickness has
      more physical content. According to a semiclassical model of
      spin-dependent transport in these systems by Barnas et
      al.,[3] a maximum in the spin-valve magnetoresistance versus
      ferromagnetic layer thickness is indicative of a "bulk"
      origin for the spin-dependent scattering. In this context,
      "bulk" means that the microscopic scattering events which
      give rise to the spin-valve effect occur primarily within the
      ferromagnetic layers, not at the ferromagnet-paramagnet
      interface. The Fe-Cu-Co samples have a maximum near 60&Aring;
      in the spin- valve MR versus Co thickness as well as versus
      Fe thickness.[8] In addition, Dieny et al. have observed
      similar peaks in the value of the spin-valve MR versus
      ferromagnetic layer thickness in NiFe-noble metal-transition
      metal sandwiches.[5] The occurrence of a peak in the
      spin-valve MR versus ferromagnetic layer thickness thus
      appears to be a general result in uncoupled sandwiches,
      consistent with the model of Barnas et al.
