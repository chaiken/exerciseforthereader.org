In 1983 Berkeley biochemist Bruce Ames, a pioneer in the development
of tests for identifying likely carcinogens, estimated that "the human
dietary intake of 'nature's pesticides' is likely to be several grams
per day -- proably at least 10,000 times higher than the dietary
intake of man-made pesticides.  -- Harold McGee, _The Curious Cook_,
p. 226
