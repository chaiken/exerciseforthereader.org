<H4>What is the Glycemic Index (GI)?</H4>

<P>
<font  size=+3 color="red"><b><EM>T</EM></b></font><STRONG><EM>he glycemic index </EM></STRONG>
 ranks foods on how they affect our blood sugar levels. This index measures how much your blood sugar increases in the two or three hours after eating.
<p>
The glycemic index is about foods high in carbohydrates. Foods high in fat or protein
don't cause your blood sugar level to rise much.
<p>
A lot of people still think that it is plain table sugar that people with diabetes need to
avoid. The experts used to say that, but the glycemic index shows that even complex
carbohydrates, like baked potatoes, can be even worse.
<p>
When you make use of the glycemic index to prepare healthy meals, it helps to keep
your blood sugar levels under control. This is especially important for people with
diabetes, although athletes and people who are overweight also stand to benefit from
knowing about this relatively new concept in good nutrition.
<p>
Recent studies of large numbers of people with diabetes show that those who keep
their blood sugar under tight control best avoid the complications that this disease can
lead to. Most experts agree that what works best for people with diabetes&#151;and
probably the rest of us as well&#151;is regular exercise, little saturated or trans fat (partially hydrogenated oils), and a high-fiber diet.
<P>
The recommendations to exercise and eat more fiber and less saturated and trans fats is excellent advice&#151;as far as it goes. The real problem is carbohydrates. The official consensus remains that a high-carbohydrate diet is best for people with diabetes. However, some of the experts, led by endocrinologists like Dr. Richard K. Bernstein, recommend a low-carbohydrate diet, because carbohydrates can raise blood sugar to dangerous levels. 
<p>
But not all carbohydrates act the same. Some are quickly broken down in the intestine, causing the blood sugar level to rise rapidly. These carbohydrates have a high glycemic index. 
<P>
Please note, however, that a GI value tells you only how rapidly a particular carbohydrate turns into sugar. It doesn't tell you how much of that carbohydrate is in a serving of a particular food. Four extensions of the glycemic index concept noted in the bibliography below address this limitation. 
<P>
<ul>
<li>One extension is called the glycemic load, which is the glycemic index of a food times its carbohydrate content in grams. Harvard School of Public Health professor and researcher Walter Willett, M.D., and his associates developed this concept as long ago as 1997, when they published journal articles on the subject. But it is only in their <EM>Harvard Women's Health Watch</EM> article and Dr. Willett's new book (see bibliography below) that they have published many of the GL numbers. For example, these resources have nice but very short lists of a few foods for which they have calculated the glycemic load (note in particular the high GI and low GL of watermelon). Now, however, Jennie Brand-Miller and her associates at the University of Sydney have calculated the GL of all 750 foods for which GI numbers have been calculated. This table was published originally in the July 2002 issue of the <I>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</I>, and I publish an extract of that table on a Web page on this site as authorized by Professor Brand-Miller. She will also publish the table in a new version of her book, <I>The New Glucose Revolution</I>, which is due out in January 2003.
<P>
<li>Des Buchhorn similarly developed the adjusted carbohydrate exchange, which refines carbohydrate exchange lists by multiplying the glycemic index of a food by its carbohydrate content to indicate the likely effect of a food on blood glucose. 
<P>
<li>J.A. Monro, a scientist at the New Zealand Institute for Crop & Food Research, developed the concept of  relative glycemic potency, which compares equal weights of foods. 
<P>
<li>Derek Paice, an engineer who has type 2 diabetes, similarly developed the concept of the substance glycemic index based on a fixed weight of foods. His book, which he has authorized me to make available online, is <A HREF="http://www.mendosa.com/DiabetesAndDiet.pdf"><I>Diabetes and Diet: A Type 2 Patient's Successful Efforts at Control</I></A>. Since this is a PDF file, you need the free Acrobat Reader on your computer. If you don't have it already, you can download it at <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html</A>
</ul>
<P>
Before the development of the glycemic index beginning in 1981, scientists assumed
that our bodies absorbed and digested simple sugars quickly, producing rapid
increases in our blood sugar level. This was the basis of the advice to avoid sugar, a
proscription recently relaxed by the American Diabetes Association and others.
<p>
Now we know that simple sugars don't make your blood sugar rise any more rapidly
than some complex carbohydrates do. Of course, simple sugars are simply empty
calories, and still should be minimized for that reason.
<p>
Many of the glycemic index results have been surprises. For example, baked potatoes
have a glycemic index considerably higher than that of table sugar. 
<p>
A more pleasant
surprise is the very low glycemic index of a tasty bean called chana dal, which is the
subject of a separate Web page that I maintain at <a href="http://www.mendosa.com/chanadal.html">http://www.mendosa.com/chanadal.html</a>.
<p>
Another pleasant surprise is pearled barley, which has a glycemic index of 36. That's much lower than any other grain. For example, brown rice has a glycemic index of 79, and wheat is even higher.
<p>
Hulless barley&#151;particularly the non-waxy variety&#151;almost certainly has an even lower glycemic index than pearled barley, because pearling removes some of the fiber. A great source of hulless barley that I have used for years is Bud and Jean Clem's <a href="http://www.cowboyfoods.com">Cowboy Foods</a> in Bozeman, Montana, phone (406) 587-5489, e-mail <a href="mailto:westrn@gomontana.com">westrn@gomontana.com</a>.  Another source of hulless barley is <a href="http://www.bobsredmill.com/">Bob's Red Mill Natural Foods Inc.</a> in Milwaukie, Oregon, phone (503) 654-3215, e-mail <a href="mailto:jodi@bobsredmill.com">jodi@bobsredmill.com</a>.
<p>
Scientists have so far measured the glycemic indexes of about 750 high-carbohydrate
foods. The key is to eat little of those foods with a high glycemic index and more of
those foods with a low index.
<p>
Where can you find what these foods are? The easiest way is to refer to another Web page that I maintain. That page at <a href="http://www.mendosa.com/gilists.zip">http://www.mendosa.com/gilists.zip</a> summarizes the
academic research on this important dietary concept.
<P>
Please note that this list and four other files on my website are zipped. Just recently I zipped three of the large glycemic index files. In particular, I was reluctant to zip the glycemic index. But I was compelled to do that because the huge amount of bandwidth that downloads were taking, about 1 billion bytes a week for about 18,000 downloads just for this one file. Because of all the bandwidth my site had been using&#151;about 5 billion bytes per week (almost exactly the same as the huge Children with Diabetes site)&#151;my ISP threatened to increase my rate even more, something that I couldn't afford. So I zipped three glycemic index files, which makes a huge difference in the byte count.
<P>
Because the files are zipped, you can download them quicker, but you must have a program to decompress them and run the file through that program. If you have a Windows computer the best program for that is WinZip. If you don't have WinZip already, you can download the current version, 8.1, free. You can download it from <A HREF="http://www.winzip.com/downauto.cgi?winzip81.exe">http://www.winzip.com/downauto.cgi?winzip81.exe</A>.
<P>
If you don't have a Windows-based computer, you can still unzip these files. But you will need a program that runs on your computer to do that, and WinZip is only a Windows program. The best choice is probably Stuffit Expander. This free program provides zip file compression and expansion support for Macintosh, Linux, and Solaris as well as Windows. You can get it at <A HREF="http://www.stuffit.com/expander/">http://www.stuffit.com/expander/</A>.
<P>
The GI is especially useful to people with diabetes who want to plan their diets to minimize the incidence of high blood sugar, or spikes. It measures how fast the carbohydrate of a particular food is
converted to glucose and enters the bloodstream. The lower the number the
slower the action. </P>

<P>The numbers are percentages with respect to a reference food. They are
given here with respect to glucose. In other words, on the scale glucose equals 100 multiply the GI on this scale by 1.4 to convert to the value on the scale where white bread = 100. </P>

New editions of the ultimate book about the glycemic index appeared in the UK and Australia in 1998. It has now been published in the U.K. and the U.S.
<p>
<IMG SRC="glucose.jpg" WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="260" ALIGN="Left" BORDER="4" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="10" ALT="Book Cover">
The first North American edition of the book appeared in July 1999.  Titled <EM>The Glucose Revolution: The Authoritative Guide to the Glycemic Index,</EM> this 304-page book  lists for $14.95 ($23.00 Cdn) and is published by Marlowe & Company in New York. The North American co-author with Jennie Brand-Miller and her team at the University of Sydney is Thomas M.S. Wolever, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Toronto, the world's other leading active glycemic index researcher.
<P>
The book includes more than 50 recipes and a glycemic index for 300 foods and beverages. The authors explain the benefits of a diet that emphasizes foods that are low on the glycemic index. These are foods that as they are digested produce a low, slow blood-sugar response.
<P>
The book has some very positive endorsements. Here's one example. &quot;Forget <EM>Sugar Busters</EM>. Forget <EM>The Zone</EM>,&quot; writes Jean Carper, best-selling author of <EM>Miracle Cures</EM>,<EM> Stop Aging Now!</EM>, and <EM>Food: Your Miracle Medicine</EM>. &quot;If you want the real scoop on how carbohydrates and sugar affect your body, read this book by the world's leading researchers on the subject. It's the authoritative, last word on choosing foods to control your blood sugar.&quot;
<P>
In early 2003 Marlowe and Company in New York published the second American edition of this book. The new title is  <I>The New Glucose Revolution</I>.
<P>
Professor Brand-Miller continues her research on the glycemic index, including tests of more foods. Her department at the University of Sydney also undertakes GI testing on a commercial basis. She wrote me recently:
<p>
Commercial testing of GI according to standardised methodology in 10 volunteers: Fee is US$5000 for the first food with additional foods at US$2500 per food.  A 10% discount applies to 6 or more foods.  Clinical trial protocols can be negotiated at additional cost.   In vitro testing of the rate of carbohydrate digestion (a crude guide to the final GI) is also available at US$500 per food. More information is available at <a href="http://www.glycemicindex.com">www.glycemicindex.com</a>.
<p>
A GI symbol program has been launched in Australia and New Zealand to help consumers easily identify foods that have been properly GI tested.  More information is available at <a href="http://www.gisymbol.com.au/pages/index.asp">http://www.gisymbol.com.au/pages/index.asp</a>.

Thomas Wolever, D.M., Ph.D., professor in the University of Toronto's faculty of medicine, has a company called Glycaemic Index Testing Inc., which is not associated with the university and does commercial testing of the blood glucose responses of foods.  It has been in business for four years and has had clients from the U.S., Canada, Japan, UK, Belgium, and Australia.  The results of the tests belong to the client, so they cannot be published without the client's permission.  &quot;We have a website <a href="http://www.gitesting.com">http://www.gitesting.com</a>,&quot; Dr. Wolever tells me. &quot;While it is not yet well developed, people can contact us through it.

If you are trying to lose weight&#151;something of great interest to many people with type 2 diabetes&#151;you may also want to study my Satiety Index page at <a href="http://www.mendosa.com/satiety.htm">http://www.mendosa.com/satiety.htm</a>.  The satiety index, along with the glycemic index, are two of the most exciting tools that we have to control our diabetes. 
<p>
<strong>Perhaps the best current defense of  the glycemic index is a commentary by Dr. Thomas M.S. Wolever, &quot;The Glycemic Index: Flogging a Dead Horse?&quot; in the journal <em>Diabetes Care.</em></strong> Since <em>Diabetes Care</em> chose to not to make it available on-line while making a rebuttal available on-line,  I have scanned in an extract of Dr. Wolever's commentary with his permission at <a href="http://www.mendosa.com/wolever.htm">http://www.mendosa.com/wolever.htm</a>.
<p>
Dr. Andrew Weil, the noted writer and lecturer on integrative medicine, has come out
strongly for the utility of the glycemic index. See &quot;What's Up with The Zone?&quot; at <a href="http://cgi.pathfinder.com/drweil/">http://cgi.pathfinder.com/drweil/</a>. He writes that &quot;we should pay
attention to the glycemic index of carbohydrate foods - that is, the ease with which the
body converts them to blood sugar. High-glycemic foods like rice cakes, bread, and
potatoes stress the body's insulin system and probably are chief culprits in
obesity.&quot;

<H4>What about Portion Size? And how is GI Determined? </H4>
<P>
The glycemic index is about the <EM>quality</EM> of the carbohydrates, not the <EM>quantity</EM>. Obviously, quantity matters too, but the measurement of the glycemic index of a food is not related to portion size. It remains the same whether you eat 10 grams of it or 1000 grams. That's because to make a fair comparison tests of the glycemic indexes of food usually use 50 grams of available carbohydrate in each food. You <EM>can</EM> eat twice as many carbohydrates in a food that, for example, has a glycemic index of 50 than one that has a glycemic index of 100 and have the same blood glucose response.
<P>
Basically, test foods are fed to various people, some with diabetes,
others without, in portions that contain 50 grams of <em>available</em> carbohydrates. The 50 gram carbohydrate portion is specified in Dr. Wolever's methodology paper (see bibliography below)
as 50 grams of available carbohydrates.  &quot;That means it excludes the fiber,&quot; Professor Brand-Miller writes me.  &quot;We have always used a 50 gram available carbohydrate portion and often relied on manufacturers to give us the composition data.  I am aware of only one instance where we been given incorrect information and therefore inadvertently included the fiber
in the 50 gram carbohydrate portion...but there
may be some papers from developing countries where the data is not reliable.&quot;
<p>
For example, to test boiled spaghetti, the scientists give their subjects
200 grams of spaghetti, which according to standard food composition tables
provide 50 grams of available carbohydrate. The scientists compare this response
with the volunteer's response to a reference food, which may be either glucose or white bread. Both for the test and for the reference foods the volunteer's response over the next two or three hours is calculated. Rather than measuring a single point, they make the more precise measurement of the area under the curve.
Then, they repeat the whole process on different days to reduce the effect
of day-to-day variations. </P>

<P>Next, the area under the response curve for the test food is expressed
as a percent of the mean value for the reference food for the same subject.
Finally, these percentages from each subject are averaged together to obtain
the GI for that food. For more information, see Wolever, Thomas M.S. et
al. &quot;The Glycemic Index: Methodology and Clinical Implications,&quot;
listed in the bibliography below. </P>

<H4>Are there Other Important Diet Considerations? </H4>

<P>The glycemic index should not be your only criterion when selecting what to eat. The total amount of carbohydrate, the amount and type of fat, and the fiber and salt content are also important dietary considerations. 
The glycemic index is most useful when deciding which high-carbohydrate foods to eat. But don't let the glycemic index lull you into eating more carbohydrates than your body can handle, particularly if you have diabetes. The number of grams of carbohydrate we consume is awfully important. Make sure you know the carbohydrate content of the foods you eat&#151;study the nutritional information on the package.
<p>
But first you need to decide the composition of your diet in terms of carbohydrate, fat, and protein. Almost all the experts agree that we should minimize our intake of saturated and trans fat and eat a lot more fiber than we do. Some other fats, particularly those from cold-water fish, seem to be beneficial. Beyond that, the battle rages between those who would have us eat more protein and those who say that carbohydrates should provide most of our calories. I'm no expert and am genuinely puzzled myself, although I have begun to cut back on my carbohydrates and eat more protein. Generally, foods high in fat and protein have lower glycemic indexes than foods high in carbohydrate. In a real sense, the glycemic index is not applicable to high-fat and/or high-protein foods.
<p>
The problem is that even among the complex carbohydrates not all are
created equal. Some break down quickly during digestion and can raise blood
glucose to dangerous levels. These are the foods that have higher glycemic
indexes. Other carbohydrates break down more slowly, releasing glucose
gradually into our blood streams and are said to have lower glycemic indexes.
</P>

<P>Before the development of the glycemic index, scientists assumed that
our bodies absorbed and digested simple sugars quickly, producing rapid
increases in our blood glucose levels. This was the basis of the advice
to avoid sugar, a proscription recently relaxed by the American Diabetes
Association and others. </P>

<P>Contrariwise, the experts thought that our bodies absorbed starches
such as rice and potatoes slowly, causing only small rises in blood glucose.
Clinical trials of the glycemic index have also proven that assumption
to be false. </P>
<P>
Factors such as variety, cooking, and processing may effect a food's GI. Foods particularly sensitive to these factors include bananas, rice, and potatoes (for a fuller discussion of the GI of rice and potatoes see the section below).  A 1992 study by Hermansen et al. reported that the GI for under-ripe bananas was 43 and that for over-ripe bananas was 74. In under-ripe bananas the starch constitutes 80-90 percent of the carbohydrate content, which as the banana ripens changes to free sugars. Particle size is also an important factor, according to a 1988 study by Heaton et al. The researchers found that the GI of wheat, maize, and oats increased from whole grains (lowest GI), cracked grains, coarse flour, to fine flour (highest GI).  
<p>
In addition, the glucose response to a particular food may be somewhat individual.
So it is probably a good idea to carefully watch your own blood glucose level after eating foods you have
questions about and determine if they have high or low GI <I>for you</I>.
</P>

<P>So, the idea of glycemic index is a very useful one. But if you find a specific food
produces an unexpected result, either high or low, take note of it and
incorporate that into your meal planning. </P>

<P>Also note that the numbers vary from study to study. This may be due
to variations in the individuals in a particular study, other foods consumed
at the same time, or different methods of preparation, since your body
can absorb some foods better when they are well cooked. </P>

<P>Most, but not all, of the foods tested are high in carbohydrates. Some
may wonder at the gaps&#151;why other high-carbohydrate low-calorie foods
like celery (or tomatoes or similar foods) have never been tested. The
problem is a technical one for the testers, because they would be so hard
put to get anyone to volunteer to eat 50 grams of carbohydrate from celery
-- it's just too much celery to think about! Essentially, from a glycemic
index standpoint, celery and foods like it can be considered as free foods. I now have a list of the common free foods on-line at <A HREF="http://www.mendosa.com/freefoods.htm">http://www.mendosa.com/freefoods.htm</A>.
</P>
<p>
<H4>Mixed Meals</H4>
<p>
Some people wonder if the glycemic index can predict the effect of a mix meal containing foods 
with very different indexes. Studies have shown that it does that job very well, too.
<p>
More than fifteen studies have looked at the glycemic index of mixed meals. Twelve of them showed an excellent correlation between what was expected and what was actually found.
<p>
You can quite readily predict the glycemic index of a mixed meal. Simply multiply the percent of
total carbohydrate of each of the foods by its glycemic index and add up the results to get the 
glycemic index of the meal as a whole. Professor Brand-Miller has an example on page 29 of her book <em>The G.I. Factor</em>. The report of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation &quot;Carbohydrates in Human Nutrition&quot; (cited in the Web bibliography below), has a comprehensive explanation and example in its section 6.3.
<p>
The three studies that did not show the expected correlation came from a group of researchers who were not using standardized methodology for working out the glycemic index from the area under the curve. In addition, their meals were high in fat, which tends to reduce the impact of any one 
carbohydrate food.
<p>
  <div align="center"><center><table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" width="80%"
      bgcolor="#FFFFCC">
        <tr>
          <td width="80%"><p align="center"><strong><font face="Geneva,Arial,Helvetica" color="#FF0000"><font  size=+2>What About Protein and Fat?</font></font></strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td width="80%">
But what if the meal contains protein and fat too, as it usually does? How does that affect our mixed meal calculations?
<p>
The conventional wisdom holds that between 50 to 60% of protein becomes glucose and enters the bloodstream about 3 to 4 hours after it's eaten. It's generally accepted that fat has little affect on blood glucose.
<p>
In fact, recent studies indicate that neither protein nor fat have more than a minuscule affect on blood glucose. This seems to be true for people both with and without diabetes. The protein studies are particularly interesting.
<p>
A 50-gram dose of protein (in the form of very lean beef) resulted in only about 2 grams of glucose being produced and released into circulation. Neither does adding protein to carbohydrate slow the absorption or peak of the glucose response.
<p>
Fat delays the peak but not the total glucose response, according to these new studies. Therefore, it looks like you can simply ignore protein and fat in mixed meal calculations.
<p>
&quot;Of much greater concern is how protein and fat affect blood glucose levels in the long term,&quot; Jennie Brand-Miller of the University of Sydney writes me.  &quot;High fat and high protein diets have the distinct potential to induce insulin resistance, which would mean that any carbohydrate eaten would raise blood glucose and insulin levels to greater heights on a day to day basis. However, the type of fat may be important here.  A recent study in <em>Diabetologia</em> showed that moderately high MUFA [monounsaturated fatty acids] diets improved insulin sensitivity, if the fat was less than a certain level (higher than 37% was associated with insulin resistance).&quot;

<H4>Pizza</H4>
<p>
Many people have noticed that pizza seems to keep their blood glucose level high longer than just about any 
other food. While the reason remains a mystery, this folk wisdom now has scientific 
confirmation.
<p>
Ahern et al. compared the effect on insulin-dependent patients of a pizza meal with a control meal that 
included high glycemic index foods. They found that although the initial glucose increase was 
similar for the two meals, the GI continued to rise and was significantly increased from four to nine 
hours after the pizza meal compared with the control meal.
<p>
<H4>Rice and Potatoes</H4>
<p>
Rice and potatoes are some of the foods most tested for their glycemic indexes. They are 
important both because most of us tend to eat a lot of rice and potatoes and because they can have 
a high glycemic index. Professor Brand-Miller reports the results of 49 studies of rice and 24 studies of potatoes. The results for rice ranged 
all the way from 54 to 132 and for potatoes from 67 to 158.
<p>
What could possibly cause such tremendous variation? According to Professor Brand-Miller, for rice 
one of the most important considerations is the ratio of amylose to amylopectin. She says that &quot;the 
only whole (intact) grain food with a high G.I. factor is low amylose rice, such as Calrose 
rice...However, some varieties of rice (Basmati, a long grain fragrant rice, and Doongara, a new 
Australian variety of rice [which is not available in the United States] have intermediate G.I. factors 
because they have a higher amylose content than normal rice.&quot;
<p>
Wallace Yokoyama, a research chemist working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Albany, 
California,  gave me a comprehensive explanation. There are, says this noted rice specialist, four 
types of rice: long-grain, medium-grain, short-grain, and sweet rice. Sweet rice is also known as 
sticky or waxy rice. It makes the best sauces and gravies, and is usually the rice used in Asian restaurants. 
Sweet rice has <i>no amylose</i>, Yokoyama says. In other words, it is the rice that has the 
highest glycemic index. The three other types of rice have lower glycemic indexes.  Among these 
types, long-grain rice has the highest amylose content and short-grain the lowest.
<p>
Of course, each of these three types of rice may be brown or white. Brown rice has a lower glycemic index than white rice, everything else being equal. Therefore brown long-grain rice&#151;or if 
you can find it&#151;brown Basmati rice&#151;will probably be your best bet for a rice with a lower glycemic 
index. White Basmati rice had a glycemic index of 83 in one study. Brown Basmati rice can be 
expected to have a somewhat lower index, but we don't know precisely what it is, because 
the studies haven't been done yet.
<p>
<a href="mailto:richj@lcc.net">Richard Jackson</a> maintains in e-mail to me that my statement that there are three basic types of rice is &quot;somewhat incorrect.&quot;  He says that there is also a sweet rice used in
oriental cooking.  &quot;It is not only very much stickier than standard Asian
milled rice (such as Kokuro Rose Brand),&quot; he writes,  &quot;but is perceptibly sweeter when
eaten.  It is typically fermented prior to cooking, whereas standard
Japanese-style milled rice is not.  I think if more research is done
into this factor, the data may prove that the difference between sweet
rice and regular Asian-style rice is different on the scale of caloric
values as pertains to ingestion by diabetics.&quot;
<p>
Among potatoes,  new and some white potatoes have the lowest indexes. The reason that new potatoes have a lower GI is probably because most of the amylopectin is less branched&#151;it is more like amylose at this immature stage.
<p>
<H4>Fructose and High Fructose Corn Syrup</H4>
<p>
An addition to the published glycemic indexes is high fructose corn syrup, which is endemic in 
U.S. processed foods. 
Fructose is not the same as high fructose corn syrup,  Professor Jennie Brand-Miller emphasized 
in a message to <a href="mailto:RonnieDbrg@aol.com">RonnieDbrg@aol.com</a>, which he 
kindly faxed to me. &quot;The former is pure fructose; the latter [high fructose corn syrup] is a mixture 
of fructose and glucose,&quot; she wrote. &quot;In high fructose corn syrups, the fructose content is 
about 50 percent. Thus the GI of high fructose corn syrups is about the same as sucrose, i.e. 60-65 
(if glucose = 100).&quot; When white bread = 100, the GI of high fructose corn syrups is 85-92.
<p>
<h4>Soy Milk</h4>
Soy milk has a low glycemic index of 43, according to e-mail from Professor Brand-Miller. The tested soy milk, she writes, has 4.5 grams of carbohydrates, 3.5 grams of fat, and 3.5 grams of protein per 100 ml. A low factor for soy milk isn't surprising, since soybeans have a GI of 25. But consumers in the United States&#151;where many different brands and flavors are available&#151;need to be aware that not all soy milks are created equal.
<p>
My wife, who like me has type 2 diabetes, recently discovered that her blood glucose rose dramatically after a large cup of chai made with soy milk. That's when we paid attention for the first time to how many grams of carbohydrate that particular soy milk had. So then I looked through the nutrition information on the dozens of brands and flavors of soy milk (and rice milk and almond milk and oat milk, etc.) in our local natural foods store.
<p>
I was amazed to find that the carbohydrate content of these beverages varied from 4 grams per 8 oz. to 36 grams. At least four brands have no more than 4 grams of carbohydrate per 8 oz. serving and are made from nothing by water and organic whole soybeans.
<P>
Pacific Original Non Dairy Beverage Unsweetened has 5 grams of carbohydrates, but 3 grams  are fiber, which means it has only 2 grams of available carbohydrate per serving. The URL is <A HREF="http://www.pacificfoods.com/">http://www.pacificfoods.com/</A>
<P>
Soyfresh Unsweetened Soy Beverage also has only 2 grams of available carbohydrate per serving. The URL is <A HREF="http://www.soyfresh.com ">http://www.soyfresh.com </A>
<P>
Plain Yo Soy Traditional Soymilk from Wildwood Natural Foods is almost as low-carb. It has 3 grams of available carbohydrate. The URL is <A HREF="http://www.wildwoodnaturalfoods.com">http://www.wildwoodnaturalfoods.com</A>
<P>
Westbrae Natural Foods’ Westsoy 100% Organic Non Dairy Soy Beverage Unsweetened has 4 grams of available carbohydrate. The URL is<A HREF="http://www.novelco.com/westbrae/">http://www.novelco.com/westbrae/</A>
<p>
You may also want to compare these numbers with cow's milk. It has 11 to 13 grams of carbohydrate per 8 oz, whether it is non-fat or full-fat. Also note that the carbohydrates in soy beverages have a lower GI than that of lactose, which is 65.

There's nothing on my Web site that draws more visitors (and more e-mail questions) than my articles on the glycemic index. Ever since I reviewed the first Australian edition of <EM>The G.I. Factor</EM> by Jennie Brand-Miller and her associates at the University of Sydney for <EM>Diabetes Interview</EM> in August 1996 (online at <A HREF="http://www.mendosa.com/gifactor.htm">http://www.mendosa.com/gifactor.htm</A>), Jennie and I have maintained a close albeit long-distance relationship.
<P>
I brought to her attention an article in  <EM>The Washington Post</EM> that was critical of the glycemic index concept. That article, by Lawrence Lindner, executive editor of the <EM>Tufts University Health & Nutrition Letter</EM>, appeared as 
&quot;What's Your Number, Sweetie? The Glycemic Index Is Science-Based&#151;and Nearly Impossible to Follow," <EM>The Washington Post</EM>, May 1, 2001, is online at <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A22159-2001Apr30.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A22159-2001Apr30.html</A>.
<P>
Jennie wrote a brilliant and short&#151;and caustic rebuttal. Too trenchant for the Post, the newspaper has not yet published it and probably never will. It is, however, too good to go unread, and yesterday Jennie authorized me to reproduce her letter here:
<blockquote>
Imagine setting up a system of rating the energy content of foods and assigning a number&#151;let's call them calories, the higher the number, the more energy they contain and the greater their likelihood of causing weight gain. We could use this system to guide food choices to lower energy intake. 
<P>
Unfortunately, it's not that simple! The number would not tell us anything about the vitamin, mineral or fiber content. The numbers could be misleading&#151;some highly nutritious foods like nuts and legumes have terribly high numbers (calories), while some nutritionally worthless foods have very low numbers (e.g. diet soda). What's more the numbers are not set in stone&#151;they vary from time to time and just a slight change in the recipe would alter the number drastically. Let's dump the concept&#151;it's way too difficult to follow. 
<P>
The worth of any food cannot be measured by a single number, but a single number can tell you a great deal about how the carbohydrate in that food affects blood sugar levels. High blood sugar levels are a risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Dozens of studies have shown improvements in a variety of clinical outcomes with free-living subjects consuming self-selected low glycemic index diets.
<P>
Like the calorie content of food, the glycemic index deserves some consideration. The foods that provide the most carbohydrate in the diet are the ones that need close attention (potatoes, breakfast cereals, breads, soft drinks), not carrots, honey or over-ripe bananas.

Little, Brown and Company brought out a paperback version of the book in May 1998 for $13.95. A key focus of this book is that by dropping what Dr. Arnot calls your &quot;glucose load&quot; you can lose weight. By glucose load, Dr. Arnot means the glycemic index. &quot;The greater the number or higher GI foods you eat, the higher you total glucose load,&quot; he writes. Chapter 6, &quot;Drop You Glucose Load,&quot; is right on target. This new and outstanding  book probably makes better use of modern scientific concepts like the glycemic index than any other weight control book.

This book is fundamentally based on the glycemic index&#151;and the author's understanding of the glycemic index is fundamentally flawed. The pages on the glycemic index in the preface (xvii through xxi) are worse than useless. Riddled with mistakes, it makes the unpardonable error of equating the glycemic index of glucose and that of white bread (as well as whole-wheat bread) as being 100. This mistake must be the result of sloppy reading of different presentations of the glycemic index that are indeed based on one or the other of these food products. However, glucose has a GI about 40 percent higher than that of white bread.

This recent paper fills two of the most important gaps in glycemic index research: (1) comparisons between glucose responses measured by the glycemic index and insulin responses as measured by an insulin index and (2) comparisons of foods on the basis of total equal calorie portions instead of equal <em>carbohydrate</em> calorie portions, which is what glycemic index studies otherwise use.
<p>
The authors tested 38 foods in six food categories (fruit, bakery products, snacks, carbohydrate-rich foods, protein-rich foods, and breakfast cereals). They found a high correlation between glucose and insulin scores, although bakery products, which are high in fat and refined carbohydrates, and protein-rich foods gave disproportionately higher insulin responses than glycemic responses. Some protein-rich and fat-rich foods induced as much insulin secretion as did some carbohydrate-rich foods.
<p>
Each of the tests compared 1000-kJ portions, which is equal to about 240 calories. Each subject first consumed a 1000-kJ portion of white bread (45.9 g carbohydrate) to confirm normal glucose tolerance. The study also used white bread as the reference food against which they compared all other foods, similar to the method used for calculating GI values.

Dr. Monro's most recent article takes the glycemic index a giant step forward. By multiplying the glycemic index of hundreds of foods by the proportion of carbohydrates that those foods contain he has developed a table of the relative glycemic potency (RGP) of these foods, a classification of whole foods according to their immediate impact on blood glucose levels. The RPG compares equal weights of foods. Further, he has determined the glycemic glucose equivalents (GGE) of these foods so different amounts of different foods can be compared directly according to their glycemic impact. The GGE is a quantity in grams, allowing it it to be treated in the same way as nutrients.

By treating the body as a machine and characterizing the relationships
between input (food) and output (blood glucose), Mr. Paice, a  research engineer
who has had type 2 diabetes for over 7 years, was able to get excellent
control of his diabetes by diet alone. Mr. Paice developed an alternative method to glycemic index for characterizing the glucose-raising effect of food. This &quot;substance glycemic index&quot; is based on a fixed weight of foods, independently of its composition in terms of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. By means of charts and graphs more
than 50 of his experiments are summarized and discussed. The effects of different foodstuffs are vividly presented in a way that is easy to follow.  His methods and results will give you greater
understanding of your own diabetes.  Dr. Richard  K. Bernstein,

He also says that &quot;good old-fashioned rolled barley packs a wallop at 100.&quot; It's hard to figure out what he's talking about, but old-fashioned pearled barley has a GI of 25 and rolled barley tested in Australia has a GI of 66.

<li> Whitaker, Julian. &quot;My Latest Thinking on Diet: All Carbohydrates Are Not Created Equal.&quot; <em>Dr. Julian Whitaker's Health & Healing</em>, January 1998 (Special Supplement). In two pages Dr. Whitaker aptly summarizes the case for the glycemic index. In a nutshell, this is what he says: &quot;For years I have advocated a diet very high in complex carbohydrates and painted excessive fat as the villain. While I maintain my stance on the deleterious effects of excessive fats, new research has convinced me that excessive carbohydrates pose similar risks....Recent research...has added a twist to the simple/complex carbohydrates game--the glycemic index. It is a way of evaluating foods according to how quickly they are metabolized into glucose. Foods with a high glycemic index enter the bloodstream rapidly, while low glycemic foods promote a slower release of glucose and insulin. This means you should go easy on high glycemic foods. The bulk of your diet should be low glycemic complex carbohydrates.&quot;
