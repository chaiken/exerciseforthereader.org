<H2 NAME=HEADLINE><font size=-1>NUTRITION:</font><BR>The Soft Science of Dietary Fat</H2>
<STRONG>Gary Taubes</STRONG><P>


<CENTER><H4>Mainstream nutritional science has demonized dietary fat,
yet 50 years and hundreds of millions of dollars of research have
failed to prove that eating a low-fat diet will help you live
longer</H4></CENTER> When the U.S. Surgeon General's Office set off in
1988 to write the definitive report on the dangers of dietary fat, the
scientific task appeared straightforward. Four years earlier, the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) had begun advising every American
old enough to walk to restrict fat intake, and the president of the
American Heart Association (AHA) had told <EM>Time</EM> magazine that
if everyone went along, &quot;we will have [atherosclerosis]
conquered&quot; by the year 2000. The Surgeon General's Office itself
had just published its 700-page landmark &quot;Report on Nutrition and
Health,&quot; declaring fat the single most unwholesome component of
the American diet.<P>

All of this was apparently based on sound science. So the task before
the project officer was merely to gather that science together in one
volume, have it reviewed by a committee of experts, which had been
promptly established, and publish it. The project did not go smoothly,
however. Four project officers came and went over the next
decade. &quot;It consumed project officers,&quot; says Marion Nestle,
who helped launch the project and now runs the nutrition and food
studies department at New York University (NYU). Members of the
oversight committee saw drafts of an early chapter or two, criticized
them vigorously, and then saw little else.<P>

Finally, in June 1999, 11 years after the project began, the Surgeon
General's Office circulated a letter, authored by the last of the
project officers, explaining that the report would be killed. There
was no other public announcement and no press release. The letter
explained that the relevant administrators &quot;did not anticipate
fully the magnitude of the additional external expertise and staff
resources that would be needed.&quot; In other words, says Nestle, the
subject matter &quot;was too complicated.&quot; Bill Harlan, a member
of the oversight committee and associate director of the Office of
Disease Prevention at NIH, says &quot;the report was initiated with a
preconceived opinion of the conclusions,&quot; but the science behind
those opinions was not holding up. &quot;Clearly the thoughts of
yesterday were not going to serve us very well.&quot;<P>

During the past 30 years, the concept of eating healthy in America has
become synonymous with avoiding dietary fat. The creation and
marketing of reduced-fat food products has become big business; over
15,000 have appeared on supermarket shelves. Indeed, an entire
research industry has arisen to create palatable nonfat fat
substitutes, and the food industry now spends billions of dollars
yearly selling the less-fat-is-good-health message. The government
weighs in as well, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's)
booklet on dietary guidelines, published every 5 years, and its
ubiquitous Food Guide Pyramid, which recommends that fats and oils be
eaten &quot;sparingly.&quot; The low-fat gospel spreads farther by a
kind of societal osmosis, continuously reinforced by physicians,
nutritionists, journalists, health organizations, and consumer
advocacy groups such as the Center for Science in the Public Interest,
which refers to fat as this &quot;greasy killer.&quot; &quot;In
America, we no longer fear God or the communists, but we fear
fat,&quot; says David Kritchevsky of the Wistar Institute in
Philadelphia, who in 1958 wrote the first textbook on cholesterol.<P>

As the Surgeon General's Office discovered, however, the science of
dietary fat is not nearly as simple as it once appeared. The
proposition, now 50 years old, that dietary fat is a bane to health is
based chiefly on the fact that fat, specifically the hard, saturated
fat found primarily in meat and dairy products, elevates blood
cholesterol levels. This in turn raises the likelihood that
cholesterol will clog arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis,
which then increases risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack,
and untimely death. By the 1970s, each individual step of this chain
from fat to cholesterol to heart disease had been demonstrated beyond
reasonable doubt, but the veracity of the chain <EM>as a whole
</EM>has never been proven. In other words, despite decades of
research, it is still a debatable proposition whether the consumption
of saturated fats above recommended levels (step one in the chain) by
anyone who's not already at high risk of heart disease will increase
the likelihood of untimely death (outcome three). Nor have hundreds of
millions of dollars in trials managed to generate compelling evidence
that healthy individuals can extend their lives by more than a few
weeks, if that, by eating less fat (see sidebar on p. <A
HREF="satfat.html">2538</A>). To put it simply,
the data remain ambiguous as to whether low-fat diets will benefit
healthy Americans. Worse, the ubiquitous admonishments to reduce total
fat intake have encouraged a shift to high-carbohydrate diets, which
may be no better--and may even be worse--than high-fat diets.<P>

Since the early 1970s, for instance, Americans' average fat intake has
dropped from over 40% of total calories to 34%; average serum
cholesterol levels have dropped as well. But no compelling evidence
suggests that these decreases have improved health. Although heart
disease death rates have dropped--and public health officials insist
low-fat diets are partly responsible--the <EM>incidence</EM> of heart
disease does not seem to be declining, as would be expected if lower
fat diets made a difference. This was the conclusion, for instance, of
a 10-year study of heart disease mortality published in <EM>The New
England Journal of Medicine</EM> in 1998, which suggested that death
rates are declining largely because doctors are treating the disease
more successfully. AHA statistics agree: Between 1979 and 1996, the
number of medical procedures for heart disease increased from 1.2
million to 5.4 million a year. &quot;I don't consider that this
disease category has disappeared or anything close to it,&quot; says
one AHA statistician.<P>

Meanwhile, obesity in America, which remained constant from the early
1960s through 1980, has surged upward since then--from 14% of the
population to over 22%. Diabetes has increased apace. Both obesity and
diabetes increase heart disease risk, which could explain why heart
disease incidence is not decreasing. That this obesity epidemic
occurred just as the government began bombarding Americans with the
low-fat message suggests the possibility, however distant, that
low-fat diets might have unintended consequences--among them, weight
gain. &quot;Most of us would have predicted that if we can get the
population to change its fat intake, with its dense calories, we would
see a reduction in weight,&quot; admits Harlan. &quot;Instead, we see
the exact opposite.&quot;<P>

In the face of this uncertainty, skeptics and apostates have come
along repeatedly, only to see their work almost religiously ignored as
the mainstream medical community sought consensus on the evils of
dietary fat. For 20 years, for instance, the Harvard School of Public
Health has run the Nurses' Health Study and its two sequelae--the
Health Professionals Follow-Up Study and the Nurses' Health Study
II--accumulating over a decade of data on the diet and health of
almost 300,000 Americans. The results suggest that total fat consumed
has no relation to heart disease risk; that monounsaturated fats like
olive oil lower risk; and that saturated fats are little worse, if at
all, than the pasta and other carbohydrates that the Food Guide
Pyramid suggests be eaten copiously. (The studies also suggest that
trans fatty acids are unhealthful. These are the fats in margarine,
for instance, and are what many Americans started eating when they
were told that the saturated fats in butter might kill them.) Harvard
epidemiologist Walter Willett, spokesperson for the Nurses' Health
Study, points out that NIH has spent over $100 million on the three
studies and yet not one government agency has changed its primary
guidelines to fit these particular data. &quot;Scandalous,&quot; says
Willett. &quot;They say, 'You really need a high level of proof to
change the recommendations,' which is ironic, because they never had a
high level of proof to set them.&quot;<P>

Indeed, the history of the national conviction that dietary fat is
deadly, and its evolution from hypothesis to dogma, is one in which
politicians, bureaucrats, the media, and the public have played as
large a role as the scientists and the science. It's a story of what
can happen when the demands of public health policy--and the demands
of the public for simple advice--run up against the confusing
ambiguity of real science.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Fear of fat</STRONG></FONT><BR> During the first
half of the 20th century, nutritionists were more concerned about
malnutrition than about the sins of dietary excess. After World War
II, however, a coronary heart disease epidemic seemed to sweep the
country (see sidebar on p. <A
HREF="epidemic.html">2540</A>). &quot;Middle-aged men, seemingly
healthy, were dropping dead,&quot; wrote biochemist Ancel Keys of the
University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, who was among the first to
suggest that dietary fats might be the cause. By 1952, Keys was
arguing that Americans should reduce their fat intake to less than 30%
of total calories, although he simultaneously recognized that
&quot;direct evidence on the effect of the diet on human
arteriosclerosis is very little and likely to remain so for some
time.&quot; In the famous and very controversial Seven Countries
Study, for instance, Keys and his colleagues reported that the amount
of fat consumed seemed to be the salient difference between
populations such as those in Japan and Crete that had little heart
disease and those, as in Finland, that were plagued by it. In 1961,
the Framingham Heart Study linked cholesterol levels to heart disease,
Keys made the cover of <EM>Time</EM> magazine, and the AHA, under his
influence, began advocating low-fat diets as a palliative for men with
high cholesterol levels. Keys had also become one of the first
Americans to consciously adopt a heart-healthy diet: He and his wife,
<EM>Time</EM> reported, &quot;do not eat 'carving meat'--steaks,
chops, roasts--more than three times a week.&quot;<P>

Nonetheless, by 1969 the state of the science could still be
summarized by a single sentence from a report of the Diet-Heart Review
Panel of the National Heart Institute (now the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute, or NHLBI): &quot;It is not known whether dietary
manipulation has any effect whatsoever on coronary heart
disease.&quot; The chair of the panel was E. H. &quot;Pete&quot;
Ahrens, whose laboratory at Rockefeller University in New York City
did much of the seminal research on fat and cholesterol metabolism.<P>

Whereas proponents of low-fat diets were concerned primarily about the
effects of dietary fat on cholesterol levels and heart disease, Ahrens
and his panel--10 experts in clinical medicine, epidemiology,
biostatistics, human nutrition, and metabolism--were equally concerned
that eating less fat could have profound effects throughout the body,
many of which could be harmful. The brain, for instance, is 70% fat,
which chiefly serves to insulate neurons. Fat is also the primary
component of cell membranes. Changing the proportion of saturated to
unsaturated fats in the diet changes the fat composition in these
membranes. This could conceivably change the membrane permeability,
which controls the transport of everything from glucose, signaling
proteins, and hormones to bacteria, viruses, and tumor-causing agents
into and out of the cell. The relative saturation of fats in the diet
could also influence cellular aging as well as the clotting ability of
blood cells.<P>

Whether the potential benefits of low-fat diets would exceed the
potential risks could be settled by testing whether low-fat diets
actually prolong life, but such a test would have to be enormous. The
effect of diet on cholesterol levels is subtle for most
individuals--especially those living in the real world rather than the
metabolic wards of nutrition researchers--and the effect of
cholesterol levels on heart disease is also subtle. As a result, tens
of thousands of individuals would have to switch to low-fat diets and
their subsequent health compared to that of equal numbers who
continued eating fat to alleged excess. And all these people would
have to be followed for years until enough deaths accumulated to
provide statistically significant results. Ahrens and his colleagues
were pessimistic about whether such a massive and expensive trial
could ever be done. In 1971, an NIH task force estimated such a trial
would cost $1 billion, considerably more than NIH was willing to
spend. Instead, NIH administrators opted for a handful of smaller
studies, two of which alone would cost $255 million. Perhaps more
important, these studies would take a decade. Neither the public, the
press, nor the U.S. Congress was willing to wait that long.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Science by committee</STRONG></FONT><BR>

Like the flourishing American affinity for alternative medicine, an
antifat movement evolved independently of science in the 1960s. It was
fed by distrust of the establishment--in this case, both the medical
establishment and the food industry--and by counterculture attacks on
excessive consumption, whether manifested in gas-guzzling cars or the
classic American cuisine of bacon and eggs and marbled steaks. And
while the data on fat and health remained ambiguous and the scientific
community polarized, the deadlock was broken not by any new science,
but by politicians. It was Senator George McGovern's bipartisan,
nonlegislative Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs--and, to
be precise, a handful of McGovern's staff members--that almost
single-handedly changed nutritional policy in this country and
initiated the process of turning the dietary fat hypothesis into
dogma.<P>

McGovern's committee was founded in 1968 with a mandate to eradicate
malnutrition in America, and it instituted a series of landmark
federal food assistance programs. As the malnutrition work began to
peter out in the mid-1970s, however, the committee didn't
disband. Rather, its general counsel, Marshall Matz, and staff
director, Alan Stone, both young lawyers, decided that the committee
would address &quot;overnutrition,&quot; the dietary excesses of
Americans. It was a &quot;casual endeavor,&quot; says Matz. &quot;We
really were totally na&iuml;ve, a bunch of kids, who just thought,
'Hell, we should say something on this subject before we go out of
business.' &quot; McGovern and his fellow senators--all middle-aged
men worried about their girth and their health--signed on; McGovern
and his wife had both gone through diet-guru Nathan Pritikin's very
low fat diet and exercise program. McGovern quit the program early,
but Pritikin remained a major influence on his thinking.<P>

McGovern's committee listened to 2 days of testimony on diet and
disease in July 1976. Then resident wordsmith Nick Mottern, a former
labor reporter for <EM>The Providence Journal</EM>, was assigned the
task of researching and writing the first &quot;Dietary Goals for the
United States.&quot; Mottern, who had no scientific background and no
experience writing about science, nutrition, or health, believed his
Dietary Goals would launch a &quot;revolution in diet and agriculture
in this country.&quot; He avoided the scientific and medical
controversy by relying almost exclusively on Harvard School of Public
Health nutritionist Mark Hegsted for input on dietary fat. Hegsted had
studied fat and cholesterol metabolism in the early 1960s, and he
believed unconditionally in the benefits of restricting fat intake,
although he says he was aware that his was an extreme opinion. With
Hegsted as his muse, Mottern saw dietary fat as the nutritional
equivalent of cigarettes, and the food industry as akin to the tobacco
industry in its willingness to suppress scientific truth in the
interests of profits. To Mottern, those scientists who spoke out
against fat were those willing to take on the industry. &quot;It took
a certain amount of guts,&quot; he says, &quot;to speak about this
because of the financial interests involved.&quot;<P>

Mottern's report suggested that Americans cut their total fat intake
to 30% of the calories they consume and saturated fat intake to 10%,
in accord with AHA recommendations for men at high risk of heart
disease. The report acknowledged the existence of controversy but
insisted Americans had nothing to lose by following its
advice. &quot;The question to be asked is not why should we change our
diet but why not?&quot; wrote Hegsted in the introduction. &quot;There
are [no risks] that can be identified and important benefits can be
expected.&quot; This was an optimistic but still debatable position,
and when Dietary Goals was released in January 1977, &quot;all hell
broke loose,&quot; recalls Hegsted. &quot;Practically nobody was in
favor of the McGovern recommendations. Damn few people.&quot;<P>

McGovern responded with three follow-up hearings, which aptly
foreshadowed the next 7 years of controversy. Among those testifying,
for instance, was NHLBI director Robert Levy, who explained that no
one knew if eating less fat or lowering blood cholesterol levels would
prevent heart attacks, which was why NHLBI was spending $300 million
to study the question. Levy's position was awkward, he recalls,
because &quot;the good senators came out with the guidelines and then
called us in to get advice.&quot; He was joined by prominent
scientists, including Ahrens, who testified that advising Americans to
eat less fat on the strength of such marginal evidence was equivalent
to conducting a nutritional experiment with the American public as
subjects. Even the American Medical Association protested, suggesting
that the diet proposed by the guidelines raised the &quot;potential
for harmful effects.&quot; But as these scientists testified, so did
representatives from the dairy, egg, and cattle industries, who also
vigorously opposed the guidelines for obvious reasons. This
juxtaposition served to taint the scientific criticisms: Any
scientists arguing against the committee's guidelines appeared to be
either hopelessly behind the paradigm, which was Hegsted's view, or
industry apologists, which was Mottern's, if not both.<P>

Although the committee published a revised edition of the Dietary
Goals later in the year, the thrust of the recommendations remained
unchanged. It did give in to industry pressure by softening the
suggestion that Americans eat less meat. Mottern says he considered
even that a &quot;disservice to the public,&quot; refused to do the
revisions, and quit the committee. (Mottern became a vegetarian while
writing the Dietary Goals and now runs a food co-op in Peekskill, New
York.)<P>

The guidelines might have then died a quiet death when McGovern's
committee came to an end in late 1977 if two federal agencies had not
felt it imperative to respond. Although they took contradictory points
of view, one message--with media assistance--won out.<P>

The first was the USDA, where consumer-activist Carol Tucker Foreman
had recently been appointed an assistant secretary. Foreman believed
it was incumbent on USDA to turn McGovern's recommendations into
official policy, and, like Mottern, she was not deterred by the
existence of scientific controversy. &quot;Tell us what you know and
tell us it's not the final answer,&quot; she would tell
scientists. &quot;I have to eat and feed my children three times a
day, and I want you to tell me what your best sense of the data is
right now.&quot;<P>

Of course, given the controversy, the &quot;best sense of the
data&quot; would depend on which scientists were asked. The Food and
Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), which
decides the Recommended Dietary Allowances, would have been a natural
choice, but NAS president Philip Handler, an expert on metabolism, had
told Foreman that Mottern's Dietary Goals were &quot;nonsense.&quot;
Foreman then turned to McGovern's staffers for advice and they
recommended she hire Hegsted, which she did. Hegsted, in turn, relied
on a state-of-the-science report published by an expert but very
divergent committee of the American Society for Clinical
Nutrition. &quot;They were nowhere near unanimous on anything,&quot;
says Hegsted, &quot;but the majority supported something like the
McGovern committee report.&quot;<P>

The resulting document became the first edition of &quot;Using the
Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&quot; Although it acknowledged the
existence of controversy and suggested that a single dietary
recommendation might not suit an entire diverse population, the advice
to avoid fat and saturated fat was, indeed, virtually identical to
McGovern's Dietary Goals.<P>

Three months later, the NAS Food and Nutrition Board released its own
guidelines: &quot;Toward Healthful Diets.&quot; The board, consisting
of a dozen nutrition experts, concluded that the only reliable advice
for healthy Americans was to watch their weight; everything else,
dietary fat included, would take care of itself. The advice was not
taken kindly, however, at least not by the media. The first
reports--&quot;rather incredulously,&quot; said Handler at the
time--criticized the NAS advice for conflicting with the USDA's and
McGovern's and thus somehow being irresponsible. Follow-up reports
suggested that the board members, in the words of Jane Brody, who
covered the story for <EM>The New York Times</EM>, were &quot;all in
the pocket of the industries being hurt.&quot; To be precise, the
board chair and one of its members consulted for food industries, and
funding for the board itself came from industry donations. These
industry connections were leaked to the press from the USDA.<P>

Hegsted now defends the NAS board, although he didn't at the time, and
calls this kind of conflict of interest &quot;a hell of an
issue.&quot; &quot;Everybody used to complain that industry didn't do
anything on nutrition,&quot; he told <EM>Science</EM>, &quot;yet
anybody who got involved was blackballed because their positions were
presumably influenced by the industry.&quot; (In 1981, Hegsted
returned to Harvard, where his research was funded by Frito-Lay.) The
press had mixed feelings, claiming that the connections
&quot;soiled&quot; the academy's reputation &quot;for tendering
careful scientific advice&quot; (<EM>The Washington Post</EM>),
demonstrated that the board's &quot;objectivity and aptitude are in
doubt&quot; (<EM>The New York Times</EM>), or represented in the
board's guidelines a &quot;blow against the food faddists who hold the
public in thrall&quot; (<EM>Science</EM>). In any case, the NAS board
had been publicly discredited. Hegsted's Dietary Guidelines for
Americans became the official U.S. policy on dietary fat: Eat less
fat. Live longer.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Creating
&quot;consensus&quot;</STRONG></FONT><BR> Once politicians, the press,
and the public had decided dietary fat policy, the science was left to
catch up. In the early 1970s, when NIH opted to forgo a $1 billion
trial that might be definitive and instead fund a half-dozen studies
at one-third the cost, everyone hoped these smaller trials would be
sufficiently persuasive to conclude that low-fat diets prolong
lives. The results were published between 1980 and 1984. Four of these
trials --comparing heart disease rates and diet within Honolulu,
Puerto Rico, Chicago, and Framingham--showed no evidence that men who
ate less fat lived longer or had fewer heart attacks. A fifth trial,
the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), cost $115 million
and tried to amplify the subtle influences of diet on health by
persuading subjects to avoid fat while simultaneously quitting smoking
<EM>and</EM> taking medication for high blood pressure. That trial
suggested, if anything, that eating less fat might shorten life. In
each study, however, the investigators concluded that methodological
flaws had led to the negative results. They did not, at least
publicly, consider their results reason to lessen their belief in the
evils of fat.<P>

The sixth study was the $140 million Lipid Research Clinics (LRC)
Coronary Primary Prevention Trial, led by NHLBI administrator Basil
Rifkind and biochemist Daniel Steinberg of the University of
California, San Diego. The LRC trial was a drug trial, not a diet
trial, but the NHLBI heralded its outcome as the end of the dietary
fat debate. In January 1984, LRC investigators reported that a
medication called cholestyramine reduced cholesterol levels in men
with abnormally high cholesterol levels and modestly reduced heart
disease rates in the process. (The probability of suffering a heart
attack during the seven-plus years of the study was reduced from 8.6%
in the placebo group to 7.0%; the probability of dying from a heart
attack dropped from 2.0% to 1.6%.) The investigators then concluded,
without benefit of dietary data, that cholestyramine's benefits could
be extended to diet as well. And although the trial tested only
middle-aged men with cholesterol levels higher than those of 95% of
the population, they concluded that those benefits &quot;could and
should be extended to other age groups and women and ... other more
modest elevations of cholesterol levels.&quot;<P>

Why go so far? Rifkind says their logic was simple: For 20 years, he
and his colleagues had argued that lowering cholesterol levels
prevented heart attacks. They had spent enormous sums trying to prove
it. They felt they could never actually demonstrate that low-fat diets
prolonged lives--that would be too expensive, and MRFIT had
failed--but now they had established a fundamental link in the causal
chain, from lower cholesterol levels to cardiovascular health. With
that, they could take the leap of faith from cholesterol-lowering
drugs and health to cholesterol-lowering diet and health. And after
all their effort, they were eager--not to mention urged by
Congress--to render helpful advice. &quot;There comes a point when, if
you don't make a decision, the consequences can be great as
well,&quot; says Rifkind. &quot;If you just allow Americans to keep on
consuming 40% of calories from fat, there's an outcome to that as
well.&quot;<P>

With the LRC results in press, the NHLBI launched what Levy called &quot;a massive public health campaign.&quot; The media obligingly went along. <EM>Time</EM>, for instance, reported the LRC findings under the headline &quot;Sorry, It's True. Cholesterol really is a killer.&quot; The article about a drug trial began: &quot;No whole milk. No butter. No fatty meats ...&quot; <EM>Time</EM> followed up 3 months later with a cover story: &quot;And Cholesterol and Now the Bad News. ...&quot; The cover photo was a frowning face: a breakfast plate with two fried eggs as the eyes and a bacon strip for the mouth. Rifkind was quoted saying that their results &quot;strongly indicate that the more you lower cholesterol and fat in your diet, the more you reduce your risk of heart disease,&quot; a statement that still lacked direct scientific support.<P>


The following December, NIH effectively ended the debate with a
&quot;Consensus Conference.&quot; The idea of such a conference is
that an expert panel, ideally unbiased, listens to 2 days of testimony
and arrives at a conclusion with which everyone agrees. In this case,
Rifkind chaired the planning committee, which chose his LRC
co-investigator Steinberg to lead the expert panel. The 20 speakers
did include a handful of skeptics --including Ahrens, for instance,
and cardiologist Michael Oliver of Imperial College in London--who
argued that it was unscientific to equate the effects of a drug with
the effects of a diet. Steinberg's panel members, however, as Oliver
later complained in <EM>The Lancet</EM>, &quot;were selected to
include only experts who would, predictably, say that all levels of
blood cholesterol in the United States are too high and should be
lowered. And, of course, this is exactly what was said.&quot; Indeed,
the conference report, written by Steinberg and his panel, revealed no
evidence of discord. There was &quot;no doubt,&quot; it concluded,
that low-fat diets &quot;will afford significant protection against
coronary heart disease&quot; to every American over 2 years old. The
Consensus Conference officially gave the appearance of unanimity where
none existed. After all, if there had been a true consensus, as
Steinberg himself told <EM>Science</EM>, &quot;you wouldn't have had
to have a consensus conference.&quot;<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>The test of time</STRONG></FONT><BR> To the
outside observer, the challenge in making sense of any such
long-running scientific controversy is to establish whether the
skeptics are simply on the wrong side of the new paradigm, or whether
their skepticism is well founded. In other words, is the science at
issue based on sound scientific thinking and unambiguous data, or is
it what Sir Francis Bacon, for instance, would have called
&quot;wishful science,&quot; based on fancies, opinions, and the
exclusion of contrary evidence? Bacon offered one viable suggestion
for differentiating the two: the test of time. Good science is rooted
in reality, so it grows and develops and the evidence gets
increasingly more compelling, whereas wishful science flourishes most
under its first authors before &quot;going downhill.&quot;<P>

Such is the case, for instance, with the proposition that dietary fat
causes cancer, which was an integral part of dietary fat anxiety in
the late 1970s. By 1982, the evidence supporting this idea was thought
to be so undeniable that a landmark NAS report on nutrition and cancer
equated those researchers who remained skeptical with &quot;certain
interested parties [who] formerly argued that the association between
lung cancer and smoking was not causational.&quot; Fifteen years and
hundreds of millions of research dollars later, a similarly massive
expert report by the World Cancer Research Fund and the American
Institute for Cancer Research could find neither
&quot;convincing&quot; nor even &quot;probable&quot; reason to believe
that dietary fat caused cancer.<P>

The hypothesis that low-fat diets are the requisite route to weight
loss has taken a similar downward path. This was the ultimate fallback
position in all low-fat recommendations: Fat has nine calories per
gram compared to four calories for carbohydrates and protein, and so
cutting fat from the diet surely would cut pounds. &quot;This is held
almost to be a religious truth,&quot; says Harvard's
Willett. Considerable data, however, now suggest otherwise. The
results of well-controlled clinical trials are consistent: People on
low-fat diets initially lose a couple of kilograms, as they would on
any diet, and then the weight tends to return. After 1 to 2 years,
little has been achieved. Consider, for instance, the 50,000 women
enrolled in the ongoing $100 million Women's Health Initiative
(WHI). Half of these women have been extensively counseled to consume
only 20% of their calories from fat. After 3 years on this
near-draconian regime, say WHI sources, the women had lost, on
average, a kilogram each.<P>

The link between dietary fat and heart disease is more complicated,
because the hypothesis has diverged into two distinct propositions:
first, that lowering cholesterol prevents heart disease; second, that
eating less fat not only lowers cholesterol and prevents heart disease
but <EM>prolongs </EM>life. Since 1984, the evidence that
cholesterol-lowering drugs are beneficial--proposition number one--has
indeed blossomed, at least for those at high risk of heart
attack. These drugs reduce serum cholesterol levels dramatically, and
they prevent heart attacks, perhaps by other means as well. Their
market has now reached $4 billion a year in the United States alone,
and every new trial seems to confirm their benefits.<P>

The evidence supporting the second proposition, that eating less fat
makes for a healthier and longer life, however, has remained
stubbornly ambiguous. If anything, it has only become less compelling
over time. Indeed, since Ancel Keys started advocating low-fat diets
almost 50 years ago, the science of fat and cholesterol has evolved
from a simple story into a very complicated one. The catch has been
that few involved in this business were prepared to deal with a
complicated story. Researchers initially preferred to believe it was
simple--that a single unwholesome nutrient, in effect, could be
isolated from the diverse richness of human diets; public health
administrators required a simple story to give to Congress and the
public; and the press needed a simple story--at least on any
particular day--to give to editors and readers in 30 column
inches. But as contrarian data continued to accumulate, the
complications became increasingly more difficult to ignore or exclude,
and the press began waffling or adding caveats. The scientists then
got the blame for not sticking to the original simple story, which
had, regrettably, never existed.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>More fats, fewer answers</STRONG></FONT><BR> The
original simple story in the 1950s was that high cholesterol levels
increase heart disease risk. The seminal Framingham Heart Study, for
instance, which revealed the association between cholesterol and heart
disease, originally measured only total serum cholesterol. But
cholesterol shuttles through the blood in an array of
packages. Low-density lipoprotein particles (LDL, the &quot;bad&quot;
cholesterol) deliver fat and cholesterol from the liver to tissues
that need it, including the arterial cells, where it can lead to
atherosclerotic plaques. High-density lipoproteins (HDLs, the
&quot;good&quot; cholesterol) return cholesterol to the liver. The
higher the HDL, the lower the heart disease risk. Then there are
triglycerides, which contain fatty acids, and very low density
lipoproteins (VLDLs), which transport triglycerides.<P>

All of these particles have some effect on heart disease risk, while
the fats, carbohydrates, and protein in the diet have varying effects
on all these particles. The 1950s story was that saturated fats
increase total cholesterol, polyunsaturated fats decrease it, and
monounsaturated fats are neutral. By the late 1970s--when researchers
accepted the benefits of HDL--they realized that monounsaturated fats
are not neutral. Rather, they raise HDL, at least compared to
carbohydrates, and lower LDL. This makes them an ideal nutrient as far
as cholesterol goes. Furthermore, saturated fats cannot be quite so
evil because, while they elevate LDL, which is bad, they also elevate
HDL, which is good. And some saturated fats--stearic acid, in
particular, the fat in chocolate--are at worst neutral. Stearic acid
raises HDL levels but does little or nothing to LDL. And then there
are trans fatty acids, which raise LDL, just like saturated fat, but
also lower HDL. Today, none of this is controversial, although it has
yet to be reflected in any Food Guide Pyramid.<P>


To understand where this complexity can lead in a simple example,
consider a steak--to be precise, a porterhouse, select cut, with a
half-centimeter layer of fat, the nutritional constituents of which
can be found in the <a
href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/SR13/sr13.html">Nutrient
Database for Standard Reference</a> at the USDA Web site. After
broiling, this porterhouse reduces to a serving of almost equal parts
fat and protein. Fifty-one percent of the fat is monounsaturated, of
which virtually all (90%) is oleic acid, the same healthy fat that's
in olive oil. Saturated fat constitutes 45% of the total fat, but a
third of that is stearic acid, which is, at the very least,
harmless. The remaining 4% of the fat is polyunsaturated, which also
improves cholesterol levels. In sum, well over half--and perhaps as
much as 70%--of the fat content of a porterhouse will improve
cholesterol levels compared to what they would be if bread, potatoes,
or pasta were consumed instead. The remaining 30% will raise LDL but
will also raise HDL. All of this suggests that eating a porterhouse
steak rather than carbohydrates might actually improve heart disease
risk, although no nutritional authority who hasn't written a high-fat
diet book will say this publicly.<P>

As for the scientific studies, in the years since the 1984 consensus
conference, the one thing they have not done is pile up evidence in
support of the low-fat-for-all approach to the public good. If
anything, they have added weight to Ahrens's fears that there may be a
downside to populationwide low-fat recommendations. In 1986, for
instance, just 1 year after NIH launched the National Cholesterol
Education Program, also advising low-fat diets for everyone over 2
years old, epidemiologist David Jacobs of the University of Minnesota,
Twin Cities, visited Japan. There he learned that Japanese physicians
were advising patients to raise their cholesterol levels, because low
cholesterol levels were linked to hemorrhagic stroke. At the time,
Japanese men were dying from stroke almost as frequently as American
men were succumbing to heart disease. Back in Minnesota, Jacobs looked
for this low-cholesterol-stroke relationship in the MRFIT data and
found it there, too. And the relationship transcended stroke: Men with
very low cholesterol levels seemed prone to premature death; below 160
milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl), the lower the cholesterol level, the
shorter the life.<P>

Jacobs reported his results to NHLBI, which in 1990 hosted a
conference to discuss the issue, bringing together researchers from 19
studies around the world. The data were consistent: When investigators
tracked all deaths, instead of just heart disease deaths, the
cholesterol curves were U-shaped for men and flat for women. In other
words, men with cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dl tended to die
prematurely from heart disease. But below 160 mg/dl, the men tended to
die prematurely from cancer, respiratory and digestive diseases, and
trauma. As for women, if anything, the higher their cholesterol, the
longer they lived (see graph on p. 2540).<P>

These mortality data can be interpreted in two ways. One, preferred by
low-fat advocates, is that they cannot be meaningful. Rifkind, for
instance, told <EM>Science</EM> that the excess deaths at low
cholesterol levels <EM>must</EM> be due to preexisting conditions. In
other words, chronic illness leads to low cholesterol levels, not vice
versa. He pointed to the 1990 conference report as the definitive
document on the issue and as support for his argument, although the
report states unequivocally that this interpretation is not supported
by the data.<P>

The other interpretation is that what a low-fat diet does to serum cholesterol levels, and what that in turn does to arteries, may be only one component of the diet's effect on health. In other words, while low-fat diets might help prevent heart disease, they might also raise susceptibility to other conditions. This is what always worried Ahrens. It's also one reason why the American College of Physicians, for instance, now suggests that cholesterol reduction is certainly worthwhile for those at high, short-term risk of dying of coronary heart disease but of &quot;much smaller or ... uncertain&quot; benefit for everyone else.<P>

This interpretation--that the connection between diet and health far
transcends cholesterol--is also supported by the single most dramatic
diet-heart trial ever conducted: the Lyon Diet Heart Study, led by
Michel de Lorgeril of the French National Institute of Health and
Medical Research (INSERM) and published in <EM>Circulation</EM> in
February 1999. The investigators randomized 605 heart attack
survivors, all on cholesterol-lowering drugs, into two groups. They
counseled one to eat an AHA &quot;prudent diet,&quot; very similar to
that recommended for all Americans. They counseled the other to eat a
Mediterranean-type diet, with more bread, cereals, legumes, beans,
vegetables, fruits, and fish and less meat. Total fat and types of fat
differed markedly in the two diets, but the HDL, LDL, and total
cholesterol levels in the two groups remained virtually
identical. Nonetheless, over 4 years of follow-up, the
Mediterranean-diet group had only 14 cardiac deaths and nonfatal heart
attacks compared to 44 for the &quot;Western-type&quot; diet
group. The likely explanation, wrote de Lorgeril and his colleagues,
is that the &quot;protective effects [of the Mediterranean diet] were
not related to serum concentrations of total, LDL or HDL
cholesterol.&quot;<P>

Many researchers find the Lyon data so perplexing that they're left
questioning the methodology of the trial. Nonetheless, says NIH's
Harlan, the data &quot;are very provocative. They do bring up the
issue of whether if we look only at cholesterol levels we aren't going
to miss something very important.&quot; De Lorgeril believes the
diet's protective effect comes primarily from omega-3 fatty acids,
found in seed oils, meat, cereals, green leafy vegetables, and fish,
and from antioxidant compounds, including vitamins, trace elements,
and flavonoids. He told <EM>Science</EM> that most researchers and
journalists in the field are prisoners of the &quot;cholesterol
paradigm.&quot; Although dietary fat and serum cholesterol &quot;are
obviously connected,&quot; he says, &quot;the connection is not a
robust one&quot; when it comes to heart disease.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Dietary trade-offs</STRONG></FONT><BR> One
inescapable reality is that death is a trade-off, and so is
diet. &quot;You have to eat something,&quot; says epidemiologist Hugh
Tunstall Pedoe of the University of Dundee, U.K., spokesperson for the
21-nation Monitoring Cardiovascular Disease Project run by the World
Health Organization. &quot;If you eat more of one thing, you eat a lot
less of something else. So for every theory saying this disease is
caused by an excess in <EM>x</EM>, you can produce an alternative
theory saying it's a deficiency in <EM>y</EM>.&quot; It would be
simple if, say, saturated fats could be cut from the diet and the
calories with it, but that's not the case. Despite all expectations to
the contrary, people tend to consume the same number of calories
despite whatever diet they try. If they eat less total fat, for
instance, they will eat more carbohydrates and probably less protein,
because most protein comes in foods like meat that also have
considerable amounts of fat.<P>

This plus-minus problem suggests a different interpretation for
virtually every diet study ever done, including, for instance, the
kind of metabolic-ward studies that originally demonstrated the
ability of saturated fats to raise cholesterol. If researchers reduce
the amount of saturated fat in the test diet, they have to make up the
calories elsewhere. Do they add polyunsaturated fats, for instance, or
add carbohydrates? A single carbohydrate or mixed carbohydrates? Do
they add green leafy vegetables, or do they add pasta? And so it
goes. &quot;The sky's the limit,&quot; says nutritionist Alice
Lichtenstein of Tufts University in Boston. &quot;There are a million
perturbations.&quot;<P>

These trade-offs also confound the kind of epidemiological studies
that demonized saturated fat from the 1950s onward. In particular,
individuals who eat copious amounts of meat and dairy products, and
plenty of saturated fats in the process, tend not to eat copious
amounts of vegetables and fruits. The same holds for entire
populations. The eastern Finns, for instance, whose lofty heart
disease rates convinced Ancel Keys and a generation of researchers of
the evils of fat, live within 500 kilometers of the Arctic Circle and
rarely see fresh produce or a green vegetable. The Scots, infamous for
eating perhaps the least wholesome diet in the developed world, are in
a similar fix. Basil Rifkind recalls being laughed at once on this
point when he lectured to Scottish physicians on healthy diets:
&quot;One said, 'You talk about increasing fruits and vegetable
consumption, but in the area I work in there's not a single grocery
store.' &quot; In both cases, researchers joke that the only green
leafy vegetable these populations consume regularly is tobacco. As for
the purported benefits of the widely hailed Mediterranean diet, is it
the fish, the olive oil, or the fresh vegetables? After all, says
Harvard epidemiologist Dimitrios Trichopoulos, a native of Greece, the
olive oil is used either to cook vegetables or as dressing over
salads. &quot;The quantity of vegetables consumed is almost a pound
[half a kilogram] a day,&quot; he says, &quot;and you cannot eat it
without olive oil. And we eat a lot of legumes, and we cannot eat
legumes without olive oil.&quot;<P>

Indeed, recent data on heart disease trends in Europe suggest that a
likely explanation for the differences between countries and over time
is the availability of fresh produce year-round rather than
differences in fat intake. While the press often plays up the French
paradox--the French have little heart disease despite seemingly high
saturated fat consumption--the real paradox is throughout Southern
Europe, where heart disease death rates have steadily dropped while
animal fat consumption has steadily risen, says University of
Cambridge epidemiologist John Powles, who studies national disease
trends. The same trend appears in Japan. &quot;We have this idea that
it's the Arcadian past, the life in the village, the utopia that we've
lost,&quot; Powles says; &quot;that the really protective
Mediterranean diet is what people ate in the 1950s.&quot; But that
notion isn't supported by the data: As these Mediterranean nations
became more affluent, says Powles, they began to eat proportionally
more meat and with it more animal fat. Their heart disease rates,
however, continued to improve compared to populations that consumed as
much animal fat but had less access to fresh vegetables throughout the
year. To Powles, the antifat movement was founded on the Puritan
notion that &quot;something bad had to have an evil cause, and you got
a heart attack because you did something wrong, which was eating too
much of a bad thing, rather than not having enough of a good
thing.&quot;<P>

The other salient trade-off in the plus-minus problem of human diets
is carbohydrates. When the federal government began pushing low-fat
diets, the scientists and administrators, and virtually everyone else
involved, hoped that Americans would replace fat calories with fruits
and vegetables and legumes, but it didn't happen. If nothing else,
economics worked against it. The food industry has little incentive to
advertise nonproprietary items: broccoli, for instance. Instead, says
NYU's Nestle, the great bulk of the $30-billion-plus spent yearly on
food advertising goes to selling carbohydrates in the guise of fast
food, sodas, snacks, and candy bars. And carbohydrates are all too
often what Americans eat.<P>


Carbohydrates are what Harvard's Willett calls the flip side of the
calorie trade-off problem. Because it is exceedingly difficult to add
pure protein to a diet in any quantity, a low-fat diet is, by
definition, a high-carbohydrate diet--just as a low-fat cookie or
low-fat yogurt are, by definition, high in carbohydrates. Numerous
studies now suggest that high-carbohydrate diets can raise
triglyceride levels, create small, dense LDL particles, and reduce
HDL--a combination, along with a condition known as &quot;insulin
resistance,&quot; that Stanford endocrinologist Gerald Reaven has
labeled &quot;syndrome X.&quot; Thirty percent of adult males and 10%
to 15% of postmenopausal women have this particular syndrome X
profile, which is associated with a several-fold increase in heart
disease risk, says Reaven, even among those patients whose LDL levels
appear otherwise normal. Reaven and Ron Krauss, who studies fats and
lipids at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, have
shown that when men eat high-carbohydrate diets their cholesterol
profiles may shift from normal to syndrome X. In other words, the more
carbohydrates replace saturated fats, the more likely the end result
will be syndrome X and an increased heart disease risk. &quot;The
problem is so clear right now it's almost a joke,&quot; says
Reaven. How this balances out is the unknown. &quot;It's a bitch of a
question,&quot; says Marc Hellerstein, a nutritional biochemist at the
University of California, Berkeley, &quot;maybe the great public
health nutrition question of our era.&quot;<P>

The other worrisome aspect of the carbohydrate trade-off is the
possibility that, for some individuals, at least, it might actually be
easier to gain weight on low-fat/high-carbohydrate regimens than on
higher fat diets. One of the many factors that influence hunger is the
glycemic index, which measures how fast carbohydrates are broken down
into simple sugars and moved into the bloodstream. Foods with the
highest glycemic index are simple sugars and processed grain products
like pasta and white rice, which cause a rapid rise in blood sugar
after a meal. Fruits, vegetables, legumes, and even unprocessed
starches--pasta <EM>al dente</EM>, for instance--cause a much slower
rise in blood sugar. Researchers have hypothesized that eating
high-glycemic index foods increases hunger later because insulin
overreacts to the spike in blood sugar. &quot;The high insulin levels
cause the nutrients from the meal to get absorbed and very avidly
stored away, and once they are, the body can't access them,&quot; says
David Ludwig, director of the obesity clinic at Children's Hospital
Boston. &quot;The body appears to run out of fuel.&quot; A few hours
after eating, hunger returns.<P>

If the theory is correct, calories from the kind of processed
carbohydrates that have become the staple of the American diet are not
the same as calories from fat, protein, or complex carbohydrates when
it comes to controlling weight. &quot;They may cause a hormonal change
that stimulates hunger and leads to overeating,&quot; says Ludwig,
&quot;especially in environments where food is abundant. ...&quot;<P>

In 1979, 2 years after McGovern's committee released its Dietary
Goals, Ahrens wrote to <EM>The Lancet</EM> describing what he had
learned over 30 years of studying fat and cholesterol metabolism:
&quot;It is absolutely certain that no one can reliably predict
whether a change in dietary regimens will have any effect whatsoever
on the incidence of new events of [coronary heart disease], nor in
whom.&quot; Today, many nutrition researchers, acknowledging the
complexity of the situation, find themselves siding with
Ahrens. Krauss, for instance, who chairs the AHA Dietary Guidelines
Committee, now calls it &quot;scientifically na&iuml;ve&quot; to
expect that a single dietary regime can be beneficial for everybody:
&quot;The 'goodness' or 'badness' of anything as complex as dietary
fat and its subtypes will ultimately depend on the context of the
individual.&quot;<P>

Given the proven success and low cost of cholesterol-lowering drugs,
most physicians now prescribe drug treatment for patients at high risk
of heart disease. The drugs reduce LDL cholesterol levels by as much
as 30%. Diet rarely drops LDL by more than 10%, which is effectively
trivial for healthy individuals, although it may be worth the effort
for those at high risk of heart disease whose cholesterol levels
respond well to it.<P>

The logic underlying populationwide recommendations such as the latest
USDA Dietary Guidelines is that limiting saturated fat intake--even if
it does little or nothing to extend the lives of healthy individuals
and even if not all saturated fats are equally bad--might still delay
tens of thousands of deaths each year throughout the entire
country. Limiting total fat consumption is considered reasonable
advice because it's simple and easy to understand, and it may limit
calorie intake. Whether it's scientifically justifiable may simply not
be relevant. &quot;When you don't have any real good answers in this
business,&quot; says Krauss, &quot;you have to accept a few not so
good ones as the next best thing.&quot; <P>
