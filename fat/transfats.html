<p>On November 12, 1999, the Food and Drug Administration announced its
proposal to include the <i>trans</i>-fatty acid (<i>trans</i> fat) content
of foods on the standard food label. A 90-day period in which the public may comment then began.
At present, only saturated fats are listed. Because many persons will be unfamiliar with <i>trans</i> 
fat and its health effects, we have prepared the following review.

<p><b>What are <i>trans</i> fatty acids?</b>
</font>

<p><i>Trans</i> unsaturated fatty acids, or <i>trans</i> fats, are solid
fats produced artificially by heating liquid vegetable oils in the presence
of metal catalysts and hydrogen.<sup>1</sup> This process, partial hydrogenation,
causes carbon atoms to bond in a straight configuration and remain in a
solid state at room temperature. Naturally-occurring unsaturated fatty
acids have carbon atoms that line up in a bent shape, resulting in a liquid
state at room temperature.


<font face="arial, helvetica">
<p><b>Which foods contain <i>trans</i> fatty acids?</b>
</font>

<p><i>Trans</i> fats are produced commercially in large quantities to harden
vegetable oils into shortening and margarine. Food manufacturers also use
partial hydrogenation of vegetable oil to destroy some fatty acids, such
as linolenic and linoleic acid, which tend to oxidize, causing fat to become
rancid with time. The oils used to cook french fries and other fast food
are usually this kind of partially hydrogenated oil, containing <i>trans</i>
fats. Commercial baked goods frequently include <i>trans</i> fats to protect
against spoilage. A small amount of <i>trans</i> fat is also produced in
the gastrointestinal tract of cattle, so that low levels of these isomers
are found in dairy and beef fat.
<p>Commercial production of partially hydrogenated fats began in the early
20th century and increased steadily until about the 1960s as processed
vegetable fats displaced animal fats in the diets of the U.S. and other
Western countries. Lower cost was the initial motivation, but health benefits
were later claimed for margarine as a replacement for butter.
<p>Although the average level of <i>trans</i> fat in margarines has declined
with the advent of softer versions, per capita consumption of <i>trans</i>
fatty acids has not changed greatly since the 1960s because of the increased
use in commercially-baked products and fast foods.

<font face="arial, helvetica">
<p><b>What are the health effects of <i>trans</i> fats?</b>
</font>

<p>Concerns have been raised for several decades that consumption of <i>trans</i>
fatty acids might have contributed to the 20th century epidemic of coronary
heart disease.<sup>2</sup>
<p>Metabolic studies have shown that <i>trans</i> fats have adverse effects
on blood lipid levels--increasing LDL ("bad") cholesterol while decreasing
HDL ("good") cholesterol. This combined effect on the ratio of LDL to HDL
cholesterol is double that of saturated fatty acids.<sup>3</sup>
<p><i>Trans</i> fats have also been associated with an increased risk of
coronary heart disease in epidemiologic studies.<sup>4</sup>
<p>Based on the available metabolic studies, we estimated in a 1994 report
that approximately 30,000 premature coronary heart disease deaths annually
could be attributable to consumption of <i>trans</i> fatty acids.<sup>4</sup>
<p>In response to these reports, a 1995 review sponsored by the food industry
concluded that the evidence was insufficient to take action and that further
research was needed.<sup>5</sup> Since that time many more metabolic studies
have been conducted and additional prospective epidemiologic studies have
been reported.
<p>Because of the weight of the evidence, the FDA has recently issued a
proposal for including <i>trans</i> fatty acid content on the food label.
One important issue is whether to list <i>trans</i> fat as a separate constituent
or to combine it with saturated fat.

<font face="arial, helvetica">
<p><b>What are the arguments for listing <i>trans</i> fat separately from
saturated fat?</b>
</font>

<p>The combined results of metabolic and epidemiologic studies strongly
support an adverse effect of <i>trans</i> fat on risk of CHD. Furthermore,
two independent methods of estimation indicate that the adverse effect
of <i>trans</i> fat is stronger than that of saturated fat. By our most
conservative estimate, replacement of partially hydrogenated fat in the
U.S. diet with natural unhydrogenated vegetable oils would prevent approximately
30,000 premature coronary deaths per year, and epidemiologic evidence suggests
this number is closer to 100,0000 premature deaths annually. These reductions
are higher than what could be achieved with realistic reductions in saturated
fat intake.

<font face="arial, helvetica">
<p><b>What alternatives exist to <i>trans</i> fats?</b>
</font>

<p>In Europe, producers have responded rapidly to the evidence on effects
of <i>trans</i> fats by developing <i>trans</i>-free margarines that are
also low in saturated fats.<sup>48</sup> More recently, these products
have also become available in the U.S., although a large share of the market
is still heavily hydrogenated stick margarine.<sup>5</sup>
<p>It is thus evident that <i>trans</i>-free products are feasible, and
that the technical constraints often invoked by the food industry can be
overcome. However, out of the <i>trans</i> fatty acids provided by hydrogenated
vegetable oil in the U.S., only 25%<sup>5</sup> to 37%<sup>49</sup> comes
from margarines, the remainder comes from baked goods, fast foods and other
prepared foods. Replacement of <i>trans</i> in such products by healthier
fats may be more difficult than in margarines, but can be achieved.
<p>In spite of this, many products including most baked goods and fried
fast foods still are made with partially hydrogenated fat both in Europe
and in the U.S. and are high in <i>trans</i> fatty acids. It is unlikely
that this situation will change without strong federal regulations.

<font face="arial, helvetica">
<p><b>How important are label changes?</b>
</font>

<p>Current regulations in the U.S. require food labels to include the amount
of saturated fat, but not the amount of <i>trans</i>, thereby providing
an incentive to manufacturers to increase the <i>trans</i> content while
decreasing the amount of saturated fat.
<p>Although changes in labeling are extremely important, many products,
including fast food, which often contain extremely high levels of <i>trans</i>
isomers, are exempt from labeling regulations and can carry deceptive labels
such as "cholesterol-free" and "cooked in vegetable oil."
<p>For example, a person eating one doughnut for breakfast (3.2 g)<sup>50</sup>
and a large order of french fries for lunch (6.8 g)<sup>50</sup> would
ingest 10 g of <i>trans</i> fatty acids, or 5 percent of the total energy
of an 1,800-calorie diet. Thus, simple labeling changes alone will not
be sufficient.


<font face="arial, helvetica">
<p><b>The following is a more detailed review of the scientific studies
behind these conclusions:</b>
<p><b>Effects on plasma lipids</b>
</font>

<br>Studies in the 1960s compared the effects of partially hydrogenated
fat with those of unhydrogenated vegetable oils or saturated fats on the
concentrations of total serum cholesterol. Overall, these earlier studies
suggested that the cholesterol raising effect of hydrogenated fat was somewhat
lower than that of saturated fats.<sup>1, 6</sup> Only in 1990 was attention
given to the fact that although <i>trans</i> fatty acids increase LDL cholesterol
to a similar degree as saturated fat, they decrease HDL cholesterol relative
to both <i>cis</i> unsaturated or saturated fats.<sup>3</sup> In a rigorous
metabolic study, Mensink and Katan demonstrated that replacement of 10%
of energy from oleic acid (the primary monounsaturated fat in diets) with
<i>trans</i>
18:1 fatty acids caused a 0.34 mmol/L increase in LDL cholesterol and a
0.17 mmol/L decrease in HDL cholesterol; whereas replacement of oleic acid
with saturated fat caused a similar increase in LDL cholesterol, but virtually
no change in HDL cholesterol. As a result, the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio
was significantly higher on the <i>trans</i> (2.58) than on the saturated
(2.34) or oleic (2.02) diets. These findings were soon confirmed in several
investigations, including the study by Lichtenstein et al. that appears
in this issue of the <i>Journal</i>, using lower levels of <i>trans</i>
fatty acids and different mixtures of <i>trans</i> isomers.<sup>7-10</sup>
<a name="figure1">
<a href="figure1.html">Figure 1</a> summarizes the randomized trials that allow a 
direct comparison
of <i>trans</i> fatty acids with isocaloric amounts of <i>cis</i> unsaturated
fat;<sup>3, 7-15</sup> also included is the study of Aro et al.<sup>13</sup>
that used stearic (which is usually said to have a neutral effect on blood
lipids) rather than oleic acid as the control diet. Overall, <i>trans</i>
fatty acids increased LDL cholesterol similarly to saturated fat, but,
unlike saturated fat, they also decreased HDL cholesterol. As a result,
the net effect of <i>trans</i> fat on the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio is
approximately double that of saturated fat. The difference between the
effect of <i>trans</i> fat and that of saturated fat on the LDL/HDL ratio
was significant in each of the six studies that allowed a direct comparison.
The corresponding P values were: &lt;0.0001,<sup>3</sup> &lt;0.001,<sup>7</sup>
&lt;0.001,<sup>8</sup> &lt;0.009,<sup>9</sup> &lt;0.01,<sup>10</sup> 
&lt;0.05.<sup>14</sup>
Thus, the probability that these results were due to chance is vanishingly
low; taken together, these studies provide definitive evidence that <i>trans</i>
fats raise the LDL/HDL ratio more than saturated fats. Moreover, these
effects of <i>trans</i> fat on the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio are remarkably
constant across studies. The only somewhat discordant result was obtained
by Sundram et al. among 27 men and women who were staff of the Palm Oil
Research Institute in Malaysia.<sup>14</sup> In that study, the effect
of <i>trans</i> fat on the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio was considerably stronger
than in the other investigations (see <a href="figure1.html">Figure 1</a>), 
whereas little effect
was seen for saturated fat (palmitic acid). The more marked response has
been attributed to the habitual Malaysian diet consumed by participants
at baseline, which is lower in total fat (26% energy) than typical western
diets.<sup>14</sup> Although the possibility that the adverse effects of
<i>trans</i>
fat are more marked in populations with a lower percent of energy from
fat cannot be excluded, we have conservatively excluded the Malaysian study
in estimating the regression lines in <a href="figure1.html">Figure 1</a>. Its 
inclusion would make
the association between <i>trans</i> fat and LDL/HDL ratio even stronger.
Also not included was the study by Almendingen at al. that compared the
effects of diets containing partially hydrogenated fish oil (8.4% energy
from <i>trans</i> fat), partially hydrogenated soy bean oil (6.6% energy
from <i>trans</i> fat), or butter. The LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio was significantly
higher on the partially hydrogenated fish oil diet (4.20) compared to both
the partially hydrogenated soy bean oil diet (3.65) or the butter diet
(3.85), that were not significantly different from each other. Thus, the
Almendingen Study did not find an increase in the LDL/HDL ratio on partially
hydrogenated soybean oil compared with butter. The lack of a high oleic
or polyunsaturated diet prevented its inclusion in <a href="figure1.html">Figure 
1,</a> but the inclusion
of these data does not materially change the estimated effect of <i>trans</i>
fatty acids on the LDL/HDL ratio.
<p>In addition to the studies summarized above, other dietary trials have
compared the effects of butter and margarine on blood lipids. Because margarines
are usually higher in <i>cis</i> polyunsaturated fat than butter, the specific
effects of <i>trans</i> fat cannot be accurately estimated from these trials.
A meta-analysis of these investigations, however, showed that replacement
of butter with hard stick margarines -- that typically have contained 20-25%
<i>trans</i>
fat -- does not affect the total/HDL cholesterol ratio, whereas a reduction
was obtained with low-<i>trans</i> tub margarine.<sup>16</sup> These results
confirm the deleterious effects of <i>trans</i> fat on blood lipids and
indicate that these may offset the beneficial effects of polyunsaturated
fat. Thus individuals who are replacing butter with margarine high in <i>trans</i>
fat to reduce their risks of coronary disease may obtain no benefit or
-- if <i>trans</i> fat has deleterious effects beyond those on LDL and
HDL -- may even increase their risk.
<p>In addition to increasing the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, <i>trans</i>
fatty acids increase Lp(a) when substituted for saturated fat. A significant
increase was reported in nine<sup>3, 8, 10, 12-15, 17</sup> of ten trials.
The null result was from an investigation that included only 14 subjects
who consumed a diet with 3.7% energy from <i>trans</i> fat; the power of
this study may have been to low to demonstrate an effect.<sup>11</sup>
High blood levels of Lp(a) have been associated in some studies with increased
risk of CHD, independently of LDL or HDL cholesterol concentrations. However
diet-induced variations in blood concentrations of Lp(a) are modest relative
to the genetic differences, and their quantitative impact on risk of CHD
remains to be established.
<p>Yet another effect of <i>trans</i> fatty acids on blood lipids is that
on fasting triglyceride levels. Already in 1961, the group of Ancel Keys
noted that hydrogenated corn oil resulted in higher triglyceride levels
than natural oils or butter.<sup>6</sup> A triglyceride-raising effect
was also consistently seen in seven recent studies that directly compared
<i>trans</i>
fatty acids with <i>cis</i>-unsaturated fatty acids;<sup>3, 7-9, 11, 14,
15</sup> the increases ranged from 0.5 to 12 mg/dL, with an average of
1.5 mg/dL per 1% of energy intake. The effect on triglyceride levels of
substituting saturated fatty acids for <i>cis</i>-unsaturated fatty acids
is about zero.<sup>18</sup> Thus, <i>trans</i> fatty acids increase triglyceride
levels when compared with other fatty acids. Eliminating 2% of energy <i>trans</i>
fatty acid from the diet would lower triglyceride levels by about 3 mg/dL;
the relation between triglycerides and risk of CHD is still uncertain,
but the resulting benefit is probably modest.
<p>Potential effects of<i> trans</i> fat on LDL oxidation<sup>8, 19</sup>
and coagulation and fibrinolytic factors<sup>20-22</sup> have also been
investigated, but so far there is no conclusive evidence of adverse effects.
<p>

<font face="arial, helvetica">
<b>Epidemiological studies</b>
</font>

<br>One of the most influential studies on diet and CHD was the work of
Keys<sup>23</sup> who related the incidence of heart disease in 16 defined
populations in seven countries to their intake of fat and cholesterol.
The clear association that he found between percent of energy as saturated
fat and CHD incidence and mortality has often been quoted as strong evidence
that saturated fat increases the risk of CHD. The original investigations
have now been complemented by collection and analyses of food composites
representing the average intake of each cohort at baseline, so that the
relation of CHD incidence and mortality to intake of <i>trans</i> fat and
other specific nutrients could be examined.<sup>24</sup> Whereas saturated
fat intake was strongly correlated to CHD mortality (r=0.88; P &lt; 0.0001),
confirming the original results, a similar positive correlation was found
between CHD mortality and <i>trans</i> fat intake (r=0.78; P &lt; 0.0001).
Interpretation of such comparisons of populations with widely different
lifestyles is hazardous, but at the very least these data leave room for
a major effect of <i>trans</i> fat on CHD risk.
<p>Several case-control or cross-sectional studies have also been conducted.
In a case-control study in the Boston area, we found a strong and significant
positive association between <i>trans</i> fat intake assessed using a FFQ
and risk of acute myocardial infarction.<sup>25</sup> The relative risk
comparing the highest to the lowest quintile of <i>trans</i> fat intake
was 2.4 (P for trend &lt;0.0001); this association was entirely explained
by <i>trans</i> intake from hydrogenated vegetable oil. Previously, Bolton-Smith
et al. examined cross-sectionally the association between <i>trans</i>
intake and undiagnosed CHD among participants in the Scottish Heart 
Study.<sup>26</sup>
Subjects were considered to have CHD if they had angina or possible MI
according to the Rose chest pain questionnaire, or an electrocardiogram
recording indication of ischemia.<sup>26</sup> <i>Trans</i> intake, estimated
by a FFQ, was positively correlated with the (LDL+VLDL)/HDL cholesterol
ratio. The odds ratio for risk of CHD comparing the highest versus the
lowest quintile of intake were elevated but not statistically significant
(1.26 in women, and 1.08 in men). Positive associations between consumption
of margarine and risk of acute myocardial infarction were found in a case-control
study in Italy<sup>27</sup> and one in Greece.<sup>28</sup> Investigations
in which tissue or plasma fatty acids composition was used as a biomarker
of <i>trans</i> intake<sup>29-36</sup> gave conflicting results. With one
exception,<sup>33</sup> however, these investigations were small, and the
power too low to reliably detect an association. The only large study,
the EURAMIC study,<sup>33</sup> included 671 men with acute myocardial
infarction in eight European countries. The overall analyses revealed no
association between <i>trans</i> intake and risk of myocardial infarction
(multivariate odds ratio comparing the top vs. the bottom quartile was
0.97). The two centers in Spain, where CHD rates are very low, however,
had extremely low <i>trans</i> levels and little between-person variation
compared to those from other countries, and thus provided little or no
information on the relation between <i>trans</i> and CHD. After appropriately
excluding these centers, the odds ratio in the third and fourth quartile
increased to 1.53 (95% confidence interval: 1.02, 2.28) and 1.44 (0.94,
2.20) respectively. In addition, there was significant heterogeneity in
the odds ratios between countries, from 0.2 in Spain and Moscow, to 5.0
in Finland and 5.4 in Norway. This heterogeneity may be due to different
amounts, and sources of <i>trans</i> -- and therefore different isomers
-- in different countries (for example in Spain, unlike in the other countries,
most dietary <i>trans</i> fatty acids are from animal sources), or, more
likely, to interaction with other dietary factors, or confounding by unmeasured
or poorly measured covariates. Interpretation of the EURAMIC results is
controversial, but in any case they do not provide strong evidence against
the hypothesis that <i>trans</i> fatty acids increase the risk of CHD,
and if anything add weight to the existence of a positive association.
<p>The strongest epidemiological evidence relating dietary factors to risk
of CHD is provided by prospective investigations. The relation between
<i>trans</i>
fatty acids intake and risk of coronary disease has now been reported from
three large cohort studies, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study 
(HPFS),<sup>37</sup>
the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene study (ATBC)<sup>38</sup> and the Nurses
Health Study (NHS)<sup>39</sup>. In these studies, <i>trans</i> fat consumption
was assessed using detailed food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) that were
validated by comparison with adipose composition<sup>40, 41</sup> or several
days of diet records.<sup>42</sup> In addition, the relation between margarine
intake and risk of CHD has been reported from the Framingham cohort.<sup>43</sup>
The results of each of these investigations support an adverse effect of
<i>trans</i> fatty acids. The relative risk of coronary heart disease for
a 2% increase in <i>trans</i> fatty acids intake was 1.36 (95% confidence
interval: 1.03, 1.81) in the HPFS, 1.14 ( 0.96, 1.35) in the ATBC, and
1.93 (1.43, 2.61) in the NHS. The higher relative risk in the NHS may be
related to the fact that this investigation took advantage of up to four
repeated dietary measurements during the follow-up, thereby reducing the
error in assessing <i>trans</i> consumption; in analyses using only the
baseline dietary measure, the corresponding relative risk was 1.62. In
all cohorts, these relative risks were considerably higher than those for
saturated fat. For example, in the NHS replacing 5 percent of energy from
saturated fat with energy from unsaturated fat was associated with a 42
percent lower risk, whereas replacing 2 percent of energy from
<i>trans</i>
unsaturated fat with energy from unhydrogenated, unsaturated fats was associated
with a 53 percent lower risk. These studies have been criticized on the
grounds that measurements of <i>trans</i> intake were unreliable;<sup>5</sup>
however, errors in measuring <i>trans</i> fatty acids intake can only have
led to underestimation of the association with CHD risk.<sup>44</sup> Also,
it has been suggested that the observed associations resulted from a shift
from butter to margarine among subjects at high risk of CHD.<sup>45</sup>
If so, the association between <i>trans</i> intake and risk of CHD should
be weaker among subjects with stable margarine consumption, and should
be stronger during the first few years of follow-up. In fact, the opposite
was true in the Nurses Health Study,<sup>46</sup> where exclusion of women
who changed their diet before the beginning of the study strengthened the
association,<sup>46</sup> and in the Framingham cohort, where the positive
association between margarine consumption and CHD risk was strengthened
after excluding the first ten years of follow-up.<sup>43</sup> Moreover,
high consumption of <i>trans</i> (or margarine) was not related to other
dietary behaviors perceived as healthy for the heart, such as a preference
for skim rather than whole milk<sup>43</sup> and high-<i>trans</i> foods
that are hardly perceived as healthy, such as cookies, were also positively
associated with risk of CHD in the Nurses Health Study.<sup>46</sup> Thus
there appear to be no likely alternative to the hypothesis that high <i>trans</i>
intake increases the risk of CHD. Although confounding by unmeasured or
poorly measured risk factors cannot be excluded, as is usually the case
in observational studies, we lack a credible hypothesis of what such confounder(s)
could be, as these associations were controlled for an extensive number
of other dietary and lifestyle risk factors. In the Health Professionals
Follow-up Study, adjustment for dietary fiber attenuated the relation of
<i>trans</i>
to risk of CHD, however no attenuation occurred in the other two cohorts<sup>38</sup>
(Hu, personal communication). In summary, prospective studies provide strong
evidence that <i>trans</i> fatty acids consumption increases substantially
the risk of CHD.


<font face="arial, helvetica">
<p><b>Quantitative estimates of risk</b>
</font>

<br>Independent estimates of the effect of <i>trans</i> fat can be obtained
by combining the effects of <i>trans</i> on blood lipids and the relationship
between lipids and coronary heart disease risk, or from the results of
cohort studies. We have used these different methods to estimate the number
of deaths that may be due to consumption of <i>trans</i> fatty acids from
partially hydrogenated fat in the amount of 2% energy (approximately the
U.S. average).
<p>The first approach uses only the effect of <i>trans</i> fats on blood
lipids, and ignores the associations observed in epidemiological studies.
As shown above (<a href="figure1.html">Figure 1</a>), replacing 2% energy from 
<i>cis</i> unsaturated
fat with an isocaloric amount of <i>trans</i> fat causes a 0.13 increase
in the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio (we used this because the effect of <i>trans</i>
on the total/HDL cholesterol ratio that we used in the past was not provided
in one of the new studies). Since a change in one unit in the total/HDL
cholesterol ratio has been associated with a 53% change in the CHD risk,<sup>47</sup>
we estimated a relative risk of 1.07 (1 + 0.53 x 0.13) for a 2% increase
in <i>trans</i> fat (the use of LDL/HDL ratio instead of total/HDL cholesterol
ratio has trivial effects), corresponding to an attributable risk of 6.5%
(0.07 divided by 1.07). The effect of saturated fat on the LDL/HDL ratio
is about half that of <i>trans</i> fat, so that the same attributable risk
would be estimated for a 4% of energy increase from saturated fat. These
are likely to be underestimates of the true effect, because the lipid-CHD
relation that we used has not been corrected for the attenuation caused
by within-person variation in lipid measurements. Also, the estimate for
<i>trans</i>
fat does not take into account adverse effects on triglycerides or Lp(a).
In the metabolic studies, <i>cis</i> unsaturated fats replaced
<i>trans</i>
fat as would be the case if the original oils were simply not partially
hydrogenated. Because unsaturated fats themselves have beneficial effects
on blood lipids, the benefits of eliminating <i>trans</i> or saturated
fats would be less if they were replaced by carbohydrate.
<p>The second approach calculates risk directly from the strength of the
association between <i>trans</i> fat and CHD as observed in epidemiological
studies. A pooled estimate of the results reported in the prospective studies
(ATBC, HPFS, and NHS) gives a relative risk of 1.31 (1.15, 1.49) for an
increase in <i>trans</i> consumption of 2% of energy. Assuming that this
relation is causal, the attributable risk would be 24%, or over 100,000
coronary deaths per year. Moreover, according to the results of the HPFS
and NHS, it would require a 10% of energy reduction in saturated fat intake
to obtain a benefit comparable to that of eliminating <i>trans</i> fat
from the U.S. diet. No benefit of reducing saturated fat intake would be
predicted by the results of the ATBC.
<p>Our first approach, using data from metabolic studies obtained above,
assumes that the adverse effects of <i>trans</i> are entirely mediated
by their effects on blood levels of LDL and HDL; whereas, the second approach,
using results of epidemiological studies, suggests that the increase in
risk of CHD caused by <i>trans</i> fat is higher than predicted by effects
on blood lipids alone. Ignoring this possibility could cause a substantial
underestimation of the adverse effects of <i>trans</i> fat.

<p>
<font face="arial, helvetica">
<b>Conclusion</b>
</font>

<br>Five years ago evidence was strong that <i>trans</i> fat had deleterious
impacts on blood lipids; ensuing studies have confirmed these metabolic
findings and strengthened epidemiologic support for an important adverse
effect on risk of coronary heart disease. These data highlight the need
for rapid implementation of labeling requirements that include fast foods.
Because partially hydrogenated fats can be eliminated from the food supply
by changes in processing that do not require major efforts in education
and behavioral modification, these changes would be an extremely efficient
and rapid method for substantially reducing rates of coronary disease.
