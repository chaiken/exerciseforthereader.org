Interpretive Summary:
</STRONG></I><BR>
<DD>Lipoprotein(a) is a small, dense particle that has been identified as a    
risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Historically, it was thought that  
dietary manipulation had little impact on Lp(a) concentration.  This study 
was conducted to determine the effect of fat and fatty acids by            
replacement of controlled amounts of carbohydrate, oleic, lauric+myristic+ 
palmitic, stearic, trans-fatty acids (TFA), and 4 en% trans-fatty acid+4   
en% stearic. Fifty normocholesterolemic men were fed controlled diets for  
5 wks providing 15 % of energy from protein, 39 % from fat, and 46 % from  
carbohydrate in a randomized 6 6 Latin square.  At the end of each diet,   
Lp(a)  concentration was measured. Trans-fatty acids raise and saturated   
fatty acids lower plasma Lp(a) concentration relative to replacement with  
carbohydrate (lower fat diet), oleic acid, stearic acid and a combination  
of stearic acid and trans-fatty acids. The impact of these diet induced    
changes on risk for cardiovascular disease remains unclear but establish   
the role of specific fatty acids as modulators of Lp(a) concentration.
