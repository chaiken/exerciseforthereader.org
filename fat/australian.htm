                <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Times">Recent
                research has led to considerable debate in the
                scientific and popular literature about which
                dietary fats are important. For many years, the
                issue of dietary fat was quite simple: reduce
                intake of saturated fat and increase the amount
                of polyunsaturated fat. This meant reducing
                obvious forms of visible fat (butter, cheese,
                meat fat) and replacing these with
                polyunsaturated oils (soft margarines and
                vegetable oils). But, it is no longer so simple!
                Questions have been raised such as, &quot;are
                monounsaturated fats better than polyunsaturated
                fats?&quot;, &quot;are the <u>trans</u> fatty
                acids in margarines harmful?&quot;, &quot;are all
                saturated fats the same?&quot; and &quot;what
                about the omega 3 fats?&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Times">The
                four most common saturated fatty acids in our
                food are palmitic, stearic, myristic and lauric
                acids, with palmitic being the most common.
                Palmitic and stearic acid are found in most foods
                containing fat. Many fast-foods are a rich in fat
                (table), sometimes referred to as 'hidden fats'.
                This fat can be a rich source of saturated fat
                since it is often made using palm oil (a source
                of palmitic acid). Myristic is most common in
                butter and tropical vegetable oils (coconut and
                palm kernel oil), and to a lesser extent in
                animal fats. Butter and these tropical vegetable
                oils also contain high levels of lauric acid.
                There is increasing evidence to suggest that the
                cholesterol-raising effect of saturated fatty
                acids is limited to lauric, myristic and palmitic
                acids. Since food fats do not contain single
                types of saturated fatty acids, the finding that
                stearic acid has a neutral effect on plasma
                cholesterol levels is of limited practical value.
                Remember also that while dietary cholesterol can
                increase plasma cholesterol levels, this is
                effect is small in comparison with the extent to
                which saturated fats increase plasma cholesterol
                levels. The National Health and Medical Research
                Council (NHMRC) (1992) has recommended that
                Australians reduce their fat intake, mainly by
                reducing the intake of saturated fats. </font></p>

                with raised plasma cholesterol levels (called <b>hyper</b>cholesterolaemia),
                is to aim to reduce all major sources of
                saturated fat in their diet. Such advice could
                include eating less take-away foods (see Table),
                trimming fat from meat, eating skin-less chicken,
                using low-fat cheeses, milk and yoghurt, and

                fatty acids are found in vegetables fats which

                manufacturing margarines which can spread at
                refrigerator temperatures. These fatty acids also
                occur in relatively low amounts in butter, beef
                and lamb fat. Recently, high intakes of <u>trans</u>
                fatty acids have been shown to have an adverse
                affect on plasma lipoprotein cholesterol levels.
                Margarines in Australia do not contain high
                levels of these fatty acids by world standards
                (Mansour &amp; Sinclair 1993) and the <u>trans</u>
                fatty acid intake in our diet is thought to be

                fats have been considered to have a neutral
                effect on plasma cholesterol levels, however
                recent research has demonstrated a
                cholesterol-lowering effect of <u>cis</u>-monounsaturated
                fats particularly when these replace saturated
                fats in the diet. Studies in Australia support
                the effectiveness of low-saturated fat diets
                containing olive oil and olive oil based
                margarines in reducing cholesterol levels (Morgan
                et al 1993, Sanders et al 1994), as well as
                reports which indicate that diets containing <u>cis</u>-monounsaturates
                from other sources such as macadamia nuts,
                avocado and almonds are associated with
                improvements in plasma lipid profiles (Colquhoun
                et al 1993, Abbey et al 1994). The Food Industry
                in Australia has responded to this work by the
                production of a number of products rich in <u>cis</u>-monounsaturates
                in the last few years. Examples include <u>cis</u>-monounsaturated
                oils and margarines manufactured using olive oil,
                canola oil and Sunola, the latter being an oleic
                acid-rich oil derived from the sunflower plant by
                plant breeding techniques. The NHMRC (1992)
                recommends that the intake of saturated fatty
                acids in the Australian diet should be reduced
                and replaced partly by <u>cis</u>-monounsaturated
                fatty acids. </font></p>

                many years, the only polyunsaturated fatty acid
                (PUFA) considered to be important in the diet was
                linoleic acid. This is the main PUFA found in
                vegetable oils, soft margarines and other food
                fats and oils. It belongs to the omega 6 family
                of fatty acids. In recent times, there has been
                increasing interest in the other family of PUFA,
                namely the omega 3 PUFA. Typical food sources of
                omega 3 PUFA include all species of fish (for the
                long chain version of the omega 3 PUFA) and
                certain vegetable oils such as canola oil,
                linseed oil, soyabean oil and walnut oil. The
                omega 3 PUFA do not appear to affect plasma
                cholesterol levels, however these fatty acids are
                likely to confer beneficial effects on
                cardiovascular health through other mechanisms
                (Kinsella et al 1990; Lorgeril et al 1994). There
                is evidence from Australian research that the
                beneficial effect of the omega 3 PUFA is most
                evident when the level of these PUFA is increased
                at the expense of the omega 6 PUFA (Mantzioris et
                al 1994). The likely explanation is that there is
                a competition between the omega 6 and omega 3
                PUFA in the body. Prior to the recent
                introduction of canola oil, the Australian diet
                contained low levels of omega 3 PUFA (canola oil
                is not only a good source of omega 3 PUFA but it
                is also rich in monounsaturated fatty acids). The
                NMHRC recommends that the level of omega 3 PUFA
                should be increased in the diet (NHMRC 1992). </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Times">Practical
                advice for most people is to eat more fish (fresh
                or canned) and use more products containing omega
                3 PUFA such as canola oil and walnuts. Because of
                the increased susceptibility of omega 3 PUFA to
                oxidation, the use of oils or margarines rich in
                these PUFA is not recommended for frying foods.</font></p>

                plays an important part in atherosclerosis
                (Steinberg et al 1989). This lipoprotein
                oxidation may be enhanced by polyunsaturated
                fatty acids which are prone to oxidation. There
                is no evidence that monounsaturated fats increase
                this oxidation process. Vitamin E plays a role in
                protecting polyunsaturated fatty acids from
                oxidation and there is suggestive evidence of a
                benefit from higher intakes of vitamin E (Gey et

                <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Times">The
                best advice is to reduce the amount of saturated
                fat in the diet. As far as possible, this fat
                should be replaced by complex carbohydrates and
                monounsaturated oils/margarines. The evidence
                from research around the world suggests that it
                is not necessary to attempt to reduce the level
                of fat below about 30% of dietary energy. Since
                the fat intake of many Australians may be more
                than 35% (NHMRC 1992), some reduction is in
                order. The Table below lists the total fat,
                saturated fat and cholesterol content of a number
                of different foods items (by serving). This is
                not a complete listing of all foods containing
                saturated fat, but it does illustrate that past
                advice which mainly focussed on reducing the
                intake of red meat and dairy products will not
                reduce the saturated fat content of diets which
                contain some of the foods listed in this table.
                In fact, recent research has shown that
                fat-trimmed lean beef can be included in plasma
                cholesterol-lowering diets provided the saturated
                fat content of the diet is kept low (O'Dea et al
                1990, Morgan et al 1993). The NHMRC recommends
                that saturated fat should be no more than 10%
                energy in our diets (equal to about 20g per day
                for women and 30g per day for men). The table
                will serve as a guide to allow choices of
                different foods each day, thus contributing to a
                balanced diet. </font></p>

                <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Times">In
                summary, preventative advice on dietary fat is as
                follows. Reduce the intake of total fat mainly by
                reduction in saturated fats, use monounsaturated
                fats where possible, increase the intake of omega
                3 PUFA and food sources of vitamin E. Note there
                is some recent evidence which suggests that once
                people have persisted with reduced fat diets for
                a time, their preference to consume the normal
                (high fat) products is reduced. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Times">In
                practical terms, this means that people should be
                aware of the hidden fat content of many
                convenience foods such as take-away foods,
                pastry, biscuits and cakes (often high in
                saturated fat). These foods might be a major
                source of saturated fat in a persons diet.
                Furthermore, where possible consumers should buy
                lean cuts of meat, trim any visible fat or skin
                from chicken, and use reduced fat dairy products.
                In terms of spreads and vegetable oils, use of
                monounsaturated products (canola, sunola and
                olive oil) should be encouraged. Finally, the
                omega 3 PUFA content of the diet should be
                increased by inclusion of one extra fish meal per
                week (either fresh fish or canned fish of any
                variety, particularly canned in brine) and the
                use of vegetable oils such as canola oil. </font></p>

                Do you buy any of your own food each day (eg.
                lunch). What type of food? If you buy sandwich or
                a roll, do you request less margarine or
                mayonaisse on the bread? Suggest consider making
                own lunch several days each week (it's a cheaper
                alternative). Suggest eat low saturated fat
                alternatives if eating at restaurant for lunch
                (try to include a salad). </font></p>

                Do you contribute to purchasing the food for the
                family? Are you aware of where the fat/saturated
                fat is in different food items? Do you purchase
                lean cuts of meat, low fat dairy products,
                monounsaturated margarines ? </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Times">3.
                Do you prepare any food for the family? What type
                of oil or fat do you use for frying foods? Do you
                trim the fat from the meat before you cook it?
                Suggest that grill meat rather than fry it.
                Suggest that after cooking place meat (chops,
                steak, sausages) on paper towel to soak up any
                excess fat. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Times">4.
                What type of oil or spread do you use at home?
                Suggest use canola, olive or sunola oil products.
                Suggest reduce the amount of spread on bread when
                making sandwiches, use less or no margarine on
                boiled potatoes (try low fat cottage cheese), use
                reduced amounts of oil/margarine in baking
                (cakes, biscuits). </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Times">5.
                Do you use low fat dairy products? Suggest try
                low fat milk (2% fat), low fat cheeses and low
                fat yoghurt. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Times">6.
                How often do you buy convenience or snack foods?
                What types do you buy? Suggest that keep a mental
                note of how often eat convenience foods and try
                to reduce intake over a period of time. For
                example, suggest carry fruit to eat when feeling
                hungry between meals. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Times">7.
                Do you think that you eat a low fat diet? What do
                you base this opinion on? Suggest keep a list of
                foods consumed over a two week period and think
                of possible lower saturated fat alternatives (an
                analogy is that this &quot;food accounting&quot;
                is no different to keeping a cheque book or bank
                account in order). If the main sources of
                saturated fat are identified for a particular
                individual, it becomes possible to eat any food
                any time by making allowances for balancing a
                high saturated fat intake on one day with a
                reduced intake the next day, and so on. [Suggest
                purchase small book which lists fat and calorie
                content of foods (Calorie counter) available from
                Chemists for about $5]. </font></p>
