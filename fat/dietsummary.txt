Not just that...

THEN:  Use margarine and shortening for a healthy heart.
NOW:   Most margarine and shortening contain trans fats, which are
       so deadly they now say, "There is no safe amount" to have in your
       diet.

THEN:  A low salt diet will control high blood pressure.
NOW:   A low salt diet is ineffective for most people in controlling
       blood pressure.

THEN:  Avoid nuts.  They are high in fat.
NOW:   Eat plenty of nuts.  They contain fats that are good for you.,

THEN:  Drink 8 glasses of water a day.  Other liquids like coffee and
       tea don't count.
NOW:   The "8 glasses" recommendation is a myth.  Drink liquids wheh
       you're thirsty.  Other liquids do count.

THEN:   Safflower oil is high in polyunsaturates and is good for you.
NOW:    Safflower oil is high in Omega-6 fatty acids and is bad for you.

THEN:   Eat fiber to prevent colon cancer.
NOW:    Eating fiber does nothing to prevent colon cancer.

THEN:   Only aerobic exercises help the heart.  Weight training doesn't.
NOW:    Weight training is as good as aerobic exercises for the heart.

THEN:   High fat diets increase the risk of breast cancer.
NOW:    High fat diets don't increased the risk of breast cancer.
