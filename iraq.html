      <h1>
      Creative Approaches to Bringing Peace to Iraq
      </h1>
    </div>
    <p>
    Last night (July 1 2005) I was listening to commentators on NPR's
    <a href="http://www.kcrw.com/show/lr">Left, Right and Center</a>
    program <a
    href="http://www.kcrw.com/cgi-bin/db/kcrw.pl?show_code=lr&amp;air_date=7/1/05&amp;tmplt_type=Show">discuss</a>
    <a
    href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/06/20050628-7.html">the
    President's recent speech on the Iraqi War.</a> "He said nothing
    new," complained conservative commentator and Bush supporter <a
    href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/tblankley.htm">Tony
    Blankley</a> of the <a
    href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/">Washington Times.</a> "It's
    time for creative approaches."
    </p>

    <h3><object>What would be a creative new approach to
    ending the Iraqi War?</object></h3>

    <p>
    The presence of US troops in Iraq has become unhelpful.  Rather
    than forcing peace, their divisive and disruptive presence is
    fomenting increased violence.  The time has come for US troops to
    go.  How can US troops withdraw without creating a power vacuum
    that will inexorably lead to a civil war?</p>

    <p>What Iraq needs is an international Islamic peacekeeping force
    to replace US troops in a phased withdrawal.  In order to be
    acceptable to all sides in the conflict, the peacekeeping force
    should be partly Sunni and partly Shia.  The only viable Shia
    military force would have to come from Iran.  Or could Hezbollah
    send battle-hardened troops to do something positive for the
    world?
    </p>

    <p>Who would provide Sunni troops?  Undoubtedly participation by
    the Turkish military would be unacceptable to the Kurds.  Why not
    Indonesia, whose previous most notable military action was to
    massively violate human rights in East Timor?  Or why not Egypt,
    the second largest recipient of US aid?
    </p>

    <p>Britain as the former colonial power in Iraq would
    traditionally be expected to provide a peace-keeping force, but
    the British have through their cooperation with the Americans
    become targets rather than peacekeepers.
    </p>

    <h3><object>But there isn't a cease-fire in this
    conflict!</object></h3>

    <p>An insurgent conflict like the one in Iraq may never have a
    cease-fire.  At the moment there is no one for the US to negotiate
    a cease-fire with.  Many years will go by and many thousands of US
    troops and Iraqi citizens will die before this situation changes.
    I agree with Tony Blankley that the US should act now to bring
    about a solution, not wait until the average American voter is
    demanding an immediate withdrawal.
    </p>

    <h3><object>Who would sponsor an international
    peacekeeping force?</object></h3>

    <p>If the United Nations can't be persuaded to participate,
    perhaps the <a
    href="http://www.oic-oci.org/english/main/oic_in_brief.htm">The
    Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)</a> or the <a
    href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/arableague/index_en.jsp">Arab
    League</a> would step in.  The <a
    href="http://www.africa-union.org/">African Union</a> has shown
    that African nations can <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union">address their
    own security problems</a> and we should challenge equivalent
    Muslim and Middle Eastern institutions to do the same.  While the
    current Iraqi mess is not a problem of the Arab League's or OIC's
    creation, it certainly is in the interest of <a
    href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/arableague/english/level2_en.jsp?level_id=11">member
    countries of the League</a> and <a
    href="http://www.oic-oci.org/english/main/member-States.htm">of
    the OIC</a> to resolve the crisis.  Statesmanlike participation in
    international peacekeeping would give a gigantic boost to the
    stature of these organizations.
    </p>

    <h3><object>Why isn't anyone discussing an approach like
    this?</object></h3>

    <p>Why is no one in the US discussing an international Islamic
    peacekeeping force for Iraq?</p>  

    <p><a
    href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40876-2004Aug4.html">The
    Saudis like the idea:</a></p>

    <p><tt> The setback for the United Nations comes as a Saudi Arabian
    proposal to send a separate Islamic peacekeeping force to Iraq
    received a cool response from Muslim governments that were
    approached to participate in it. The Saudis envision the
    deployment of thousands of Islamic troops, serving under a
    U.N. mandate, to help stabilize Iraq and potentially replace the
    U.S.-led force there. Annan said today that the initiative also
    calls for providing security for U.N. personnel.</tt></p>

    <p><tt>But several countries that have been asked to serve in the
    force -- including Pakistan, Egypt and Malaysia -- said this week
    it is too dangerous to send troops. "It is better for us to wait
    for a while and to see how the situation is," Malaysia's Prime
    Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.</tt></p>

    <p><tt>State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that the
    Saudi government "may wish to continue exploring this. We'll see
    how that develops. The United States has certainly been
    interested, and we'll keep talking to other countries about
    it."</tt>
    </p>

    <p><a href="http://www.benadorassociates.com/article/628">Amir
    Taheri</a> said in 2003:</p>

    <p><tt>The Pakistanis, meanwhile, wanted the summit to create a
    pan-Islamic peacekeeping force for Iraq to which individual OIC
    member states would contribute men and materiel as they saw
    fit.</tt>
    </p>

    <p>Also in 2003, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul "<a
    href="http://www.byegm.gov.tr/YAYINLARIMIZ/CHR/ING2003/10/03x10x14.HTM#%203">proposed</a>
    the establishment of an Islamic peacekeeping force under which
    Turkey's fellow OIC member countries would send troops to Iraq."
    </p>

    <p>Convincing potential contributors of troops to participate in
    an Islamic peacekeeping force won't be easy, but trying to form
    such a force is better than the failed strategy our government is
    pursuing now.  Colin Powell can salvage what's left of his
    reputation by calling for a phased withdrawal from Iraq.  John
    McCain can jumpstart his 2008 campaign by endorsing this bold
    idea.  It's time for the national groupthink on Iraq to end!
