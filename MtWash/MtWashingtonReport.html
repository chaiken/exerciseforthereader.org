The most difficult road bike hill climb in the U.S. and perhaps the
 world, this road is only open to bikes during the annual hill climb
 race usually held in August and at times for several hours for a
 practice ride shortly before the race.  No concession to gradient was
 made as it starts out steep and never lets up all the way to the top.

<p>
Woot!  I had to try it.  That meant getting up at 4:45 AM on February
1st, 2009, as the registration opened at 8 AM Eastern Time.  In 2008,
the 600-person field filled in 7 minutes.  The fact that my family
lives near Mt. Washington in northern New Hampshire meant that the
race could be part of a longer vacation.  A friend of my father's told
him that the gradient was so steep that cyclists had to stand the
entire way.  As a <a href="http://www.lowkey.djconnel.com/">Low-Key
Hillclimber</a> and veteran of
many <a href="http://www.actc.org/">Almaden Cycle Touring
Club</a> <a href="http://www.actc.org/billygoats/index.php">"billygoat"</a>
hills of gradient greater than 20%, I knew that I would not have to
stand for much of an average-12% climb.  Nonetheless, the 4725'
elevation gain over 7.4 miles was a bit scary, especially when paired
with the 22% finish, reminiscent of our
local <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~lucasp/grade/mountdiablo.html">Mt. Diablo's
16% finish</a>.  You do have to wonder about an event where the
winningest riders in both
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Hamilton">men's</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genevi%C3%A8ve_Jeanson">women's</a>
categories are under long-term ban by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
</p>

<p>According to Summerson, Mt. Washington has the toughest 5-mile
  climb in the U.S., with an average 12.1% slope over that distance.
  The Angliru featured in the Vuelta a Espana goes up at an average
  gradient of 10.1% over 7.8 miles, while the infamous L'Alpe d'Huez
  of the Tour de France rises up 8.4% over 8.1 miles.  By comparison,
  local
  lung-buster <a href="http://lowkey.djconnel.com/2009/week8/">Alba</a>
  climbs 2050' over 3.9 miles for an average 10% grade, with the
  fearsome
  <a href="http://lowkey.djconnel.com/2007/week3/results.html">Bohlmann-On
  Orbit</a> rising 2337' over 4.7 miles for a similar 10%.
  Mt. Washington thus has about twice the elevation gain of
  Bohlmann-On Orbit over significantly less than twice the distance.
  As a frequent climber of these Bay Area hills, I normally ride a
  52-39-30 in the front and an 11-27 in the back and definitely had
  occasion to use my lowest gear at Mt. Washington.
</p>

<p>The race was on August 15th, 2009.  I flew out to New England on
  the 13th and stayed
  with <a href="http://www.villageskiandsport.com/">my brother</a>.
  Jim Chaskin of <a href="http://www.bicycleoutfitter.com/">The
  Bicycle Outfitter</a> packed my bike up and shipped it, and thanks
  to help from friend Michele Rae, UPS figured out where it was and
  delivered it on the 14th.  The night before the race, my father,
  brother and their wives and I stayed over at the Mt. Madison Motel
  in Gorham, NH.
</p>

<p>The morning of the event, I drove out to the Glen View Cafe at the
  base of the Mountain and had breakfast with a few other
  participants.  Mt. Washington is famous for its bad weather, but
  August 15th dawned clear and warm.  The summit was clearly visible
  from the base, and riders could see how nearby and high it was!
</p>

<p>
The race start was amusing because I showed up in
  my <a href="http://www.altovelo.org/">Alto Velo</a> kit, and the
  P.A. announcer clearly thought I was one of
  the <a href="http://www.webcorcycling.com/">Webcor women pros</a>.
  A Colavita rider I spoke to was very friendly as she clearly was
  wondering why she didn't recognize me.  We 500+ riders went off in
  five flights all initiated by a loud gun.  I was in the 4th of 5th
  flights, presumably based on the estimated time (90 minutes) I
  submitted.

<p>As noted in
  the <a href="http://www.velonews.com/article/96672">press
  coverage</a>, the day was beautiful, and riders were actually hot at
  the bottom.  The road surface was mostly smooth and wide in the
  first five miles.  While I could tell that we were definitely going
  uphill, the variable 10-15% grade didn't seem any worse than going
  up Hicks or Montebello, because it wasn't.  There were two
  kilometer-long stretches averaging > 14%, on one of which I did
  stand a bit, but for the most part I was taking it easy and
  conserving my energy.  I was pretty nervous when we hit the
  dirt/gravel section at about mile 5, but since there had been just a
  bit of recent rain, the roadbed was packed and traction was good.  I
  rode on the embedded-gravel section in the center of the road since
  I was worried about slipping my traction wheel when the dirt turned
  up, but then I was nervous about flatting on some of the
  sharper-looking rocks.  Everyone definitely breathed a sigh of
  relief when they got back on pavement at about mile 6.5.</p>

<p>By this point, the road was a bit narrow and twisty.   The views were
spectacular since the day was so clear: 360-degree panoramas of all of
the craggy and green Presidential Range.    By this point, I was
having a fabulous time and knew I was going to make it all the way to
the top, so I picked up the pace a wee bit.    The whole way I was
passing riders who were resting or walking, and now I started passing
folks who were still riding.    As we approached the summit, we
entered some mist.</p>

<p>In the last mile, I started to go past a lot of spectators.   There
had been scattered fans all the way up, but as we got into the last
half-mile, real crowds were lining the road.    At about a
quarter-mile out, I saw that my brother had chalked my name on the
roadbed!    That really surprised me, and I clicked up a couple of a
gears and accelerated, which caused a couple of spectators to hoot
encouragement at me.</p>

<p>View of the last wall just before the road narrows and the pavement
deteriorates.</p></div>

<p>I came around the final big turn and saw the last wall, which is as
steep as <a href="http://www.catshill.org/">Cat's Hill,</a> but 50
yards long, with two hairpin turns and several big potholes.  If those
challenges weren't enough, I saw that the road was only 12-15' wide,
and at the edge were not barriers or course marshals, but spectators
with flailing arms and baby strollers.  Yikes!  I was reminded of
photos of Liege-Bastogne-Liege or the Tour of Flanders:

Muur van Geraardsbergen in Ronde van Vlaanderen (Tour of Flanders) for
women. At least there's a rope between the riders and the crowd.

</p></div>

<p>I had plenty of energy to put on a sprint to the finish, but I was
scared.  I stay seated, and moving my eyes rapidly between the
spectators and the potholes, ground up the final climb.  I bobbled in
a giant pothole but did not go over.  As I hit the first hairpin, I
heard my family screaming, "GO ALISON!  GO!"  They must have been
inches away from me although I hadn't seen them.</p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="MtWashingtonFinish3.jpg"><img class="image" alt="about halfway"
src="smallMtWashingtonFinish3.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Okay, it was hard.<br/></p>
</div>

<p>Later on my family told me that: a) the woman's overall winner Sue
Schlatter had fallen on the same pothole while standing and pumping;
and b) spectators had knocked over a unicyclist who was insane enough
to ride up Mt. Washington.    I'm glad I was conservative on the final
bit as, hey, I already had road rash at the start!</p>

<p>I rolled around the final bend and over the finish to have attendants
grab me, put a blanket over me, and hand me water.     Awesome.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.velonews.com/results/96672">I was 12/17 in my
W45-50 category</a>, which includes the top two women's finishers.  In
retrospect, I could have gone about 10 or 15 minutes faster than my
108-minute finish, but I was nervous about the gravel section and the
22-24% finish and went quite slow at the bottom.  My tracklog on
Google MyMaps includes my warm-up as well as the race.
</p>

<p>After the event, my family gave me a ride down, as racers were not
  allowed to descend.
  Hell, <a href="http://www.mountwashingtonautoroad.com/Page-23.html">a
  lot of cars</a> are not allowed to drive up!
</p>

<p>All in all, the race was a wonderful experience.  I forget how
beautiful New England is between visits.  I totally recommend racing
in front of your family even if they are not sports fans.</p>
