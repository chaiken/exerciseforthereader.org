      Figure 1(a) is an example of the domain structure observed
      during the magnetization reversal of the NiO/NiFe bilayer
      along the direction indicated by the arrow. In this picture,
      the domain configuration is entirely associated with the
      defect structure of the sample, revealed in reflected light
      [Fig. 1(b)] and in transmitted polarized light [Fig. 1c]. In
      Figure 1(b) NiFe surface steps parallel to the [100]
      direction, which are associated with slip lines of screw
      dislocations are revealed. Figure 1c shows the birefringence
      picture due to microstresses caused by edge dislocations
      which are drawn up along and slip planes. Both edge and screw
      dislocations were introduced into the MgO substrate during
      cleaving before the NiO/NiFe bilayer deposition. The screw
      dislocation steps shown in Fig. 1(b) indicate that these MgO
      dislocations propagate through the NiO and permalloy films
      during their epitaxial growth. It is important to note the
      edge dislocations play the role of domain nucleation centers
      despite the fact that they don't introduce steps on the film
      interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NiO/NiFe hysteresis loop measured along the [010]
      direction, which coincides with the direction of a magnetic
      field applied during the bilayer growth, is shown in Fig.
      2(a). It exhibits an exchange shift
      (<strong>H</strong><sub><strong>E</strong></sub> = 20 Oe) and
      an enhanced coercive force
      (<strong>H</strong><sub><strong>C</strong></sub> = 26 Oe)
      compared to the coercivity of the MgO/NiFe system
      (<strong>H</strong><sub><strong>E</strong></sub>
      <sup><strong>F</strong></sup> = 0,
      <strong>H</strong><sub><strong>C</strong></sub>
      <sup><strong>F</strong></sup> = 2 Oe). The MOIF patterns in
      Figs. 2(b)-2(h) display the behavior of the domain structure
      of the NiO/NiFe bilayer during the magnetization reversal
      process. Letters on the hysteresis loop [Fig. 2(a)] refer to
      the conditions of the corresponding MOIF patterns. Three
      principal features of the bilayer magnetization reversal are
      worth noting. (1) The reversal occurs as a result of
      nucleation and subsequent growth of domains having a new
      magnetization orientation. Nuclei of domains with reversed
      magnetization form at a magnetic field close to the coercive
      field [Fig. 2(b)], and their growth encompasses the whole
      sample within a small field range of H, resulting in an
      almost square hysteresis loop. This implies that the
      magnetization reversal is limited by the nucleation process.
      (2) An asymmetry is observed in the activity of the domain
      nucleation centers. When the magnetic field is aligned
      against the unidirectional anisotropy axis, the nucleation of
      domains occurs at the film edges (or other chemical
      inhomogeneities), Fig. 2(b). However, when the field is
      aligned along this axis, the domain nucleation takes place at
      dislocation slip planes and their intersections, Fig. 2(f).
      (3) The dislocations not only influence the domain nucleation
      but also impede the domain wall motion. As a result, the
      specific head-to-head domain walls consist of sections
      parallel to the dislocation slip plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that the NiFe film grown on MgO
      without an AF NiO layer has a similar dislocation structure,
      but its domain structure behaves differently. In this latter
      film, there is no shift in its hysteresis loop, its coercive
      force is very small
      (<strong>H</strong><sub><strong>C</strong></sub>
      <sup><strong>F</strong></sup> = 2 Oe), and the dislocation
      structure did not exhibit much influence on the domain wall
      behavior. In the case of the MgO/NiFe film, the formation of
      domains with reversed magnetization was observed at film
      edges for both applied field directions parallel to the easy
      axis, and there was no asymmetry in the activity of its
      nucleation centers. These observations imply that the
      dislocations in the NiO/NiFe bilayer influence primarily the
      spin configuration statics and dynamics in the AF layer which
      is exchange- coupled with the spins in the FM layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hysteresis loop and MOIF images taken during
      magnetization reversal along a direction perpendicular to the
      unidirectional anisotropy axis in the NiO/NiFe bilayer are
      shown in Fig. 3. In this case, a much different reversal
      mechanism was found. The hard axis magnetization curve was
      nearly linear and saturated near
      2<strong>H<sub>E</sub></strong>. The hysteresis loop
      displayed almost zero coercivity and no field shift. The MOIF
      images show that the reversal proceeds by incoherent
      magnetization rotation. Fig. 3(b) shows the MOIF image for
      the bilayer when in the saturated state. Note, there is no
      vertical component to the magnetostatic field in this case at
      the sample edge (which is parallel to the right side of the
      picture frame, but indented <img width="17" height="15"
      align="bottom" border="0" src="img2.png" alt="$\approx$" />
      20 &micro;m). When the magnetic field was reduced, the
      non-homogeneous MOIF image [Fig. 3(c)] corresponding to the
      dislocation structure (Fig. 1) appeared. Since the directions
      of the magnetization vectors in Fig. 3(c) are not parallel to
      the unidirectional anisotropy axis, it is obvious that the
      dislocation microstresses have changed the effective magnetic
      anisotropy. However, at zero applied field the magnetization
      becomes nearly uniform and is aligned along the
      unidirectional anisotropy axis. This alignment is revealed by
      the presence of the stray field induced vertical white stripe
      at the right-hand edge of the film [Fig. 3(d)].
