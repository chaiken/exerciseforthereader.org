      Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>
      The unusual phenomena of unidirectional anisotropy was
      revealed over forty years ago in ferromagnetic (FM) Co fine
      particles with an oxidized antiferromagnetic (AF) shell.[1]
      This results in a shift of the hysteresis loop of the
      ferromagnet away from the zero-field axis. The same effect
      has since been observed in layered structures.[2-5] This
      effect was the first of several fascinating phenomena [6-8]
      caused by exchange coupling between neighboring layers with
      different magnetic order which have opened possibilities for
      exciting new practical applications.[9,10]
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first model the authors[1] proposed that the
      interfacial exchange coupling was comparable to the atomic
      exchange coupling in bulk FM or AF materials. That model,
      however, fails to describe the small magnitude of the
      measured exchange anisotropy field, HE. Therefore, new models
      have been proposed which explain the measured HE value after
      taking into account domain wall formation in the AF layer and
      the presence of a random exchange field due to monatomic
      steps at the FM/AF interface.[11,12]
    </p>
    <p>
      Other drastic discrepancies between theory and experimental
      data have also been reported.[2,13-15] For instance, it is
      well known that the coercivity,
      <strong>H</strong><sub><strong>C</strong></sub>, of a FM film
      in contact with an AF layer is enhanced compared to the
      "free" FM layer. However, there is no model, which describes
      this enhancement. This phenomenon cannot be understood in
      terms of a spin coherent rotation model.[1] In this latter
      case the interfacial exchange coupling, leads only to a shift
      in the hysteresis loop. The coercivity of the AF/FM bilayer
      remains equal to the coercivity of the "free" FM layer:
      <strong>H<sub>C</sub><sup>F</sup> =
      2K<sub>F</sub>/M<sub>S</sub></strong>, where
      <strong>K</strong><sub><strong>F</strong></sub> and
      <strong>M</strong><sub><strong>S</strong></sub> are the
      uniaxial anisotropy and the saturation magnetization of the
      ferromagnet, respectively. A model[11] incorporating a
      1-dimensional planar domain wall in the AF layer, does
      predict the same value of
      <strong>H</strong><sub><strong>C</strong></sub> for both
      small and large interfacial exchange couplings, and even to
      lowered <strong>H</strong><sub><strong>C</strong></sub> for
      intermediate coupling magnitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be thought that in an AF/FM bilayer the magnetization
      process in an ultra-thin FM film proceeds most likely by
      either non-uniform spin rotation or by domain wall nucleation
      and motion. These magnetization processes should be
      accompanied by inhomogeneities in the AF spin distribution
      both across and along the interface. We will show that the
      increased coercive force in the AF/FM bilayer may be
      explained by taking into account the nucleation of domains in
      the AF layer with walls having components which are both
      parallel and perpendicular to the AF/FM interface.
