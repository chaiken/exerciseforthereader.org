      The single films and bilayers were grown in a multilayer
      deposition system using ion beam sputtering (IBS). The system
      has been described in detail elsewhere.[28,29] Single crystal
      polished (001) oriented MgO substrates and Si substrates with
      native oxide layers were placed side by side in substrate
      holders with bias magnets. The bias magnets produce a uniform
      magnetic field, H<sub>b</sub>, of 300 Oe at the substrate
      surface. The substrate temperature was monitored but not
      controlled and reached about 80&deg; during deposition. The
      NiO layers were grown using a new IBS process.[30] The NiO is
      deposited by directly sputtering a NiO target[31] with a
      neutralized 750V, 30 mA Ar-ion beam which produces a
      deposition rate of about 0.2 &Aring;/sec. No additional
      reactive gas is introduced during the deposition. The NiFe
      layers were then grown immediately on top of the NiO using a
      500V, 20 mA ion beam without neutralization. The Ar gas
      pressure during deposition was typically 0.25 mTorr. The Ni:O
      ratio of films produced using this process was measured using
      Rutherford back-scattering and was determined to be 1:1 to
      within 1%. NiFe films were deposited from a
      Ni<sub>81</sub>Fe<sub>19</sub> sputter target.
    </p>

      The morphology of the NiO/NiFe bilayers was probed using
      x-ray diffraction (XRD). Symmetric x-ray scans were performed
      on a 18 kW Rigaku rotating anode diffractometer with a
      diffracted beam monochromator using Cu K<sub>alpha</sub>
      radiation. Phi scans were performed on a four-circle
      goniometer using Cu radiation at Stanford University.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnetic properties of the bilayer films were measured
      with a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) equipped with two
      sets of orthogonal pick-up coils. The use of two sets of
      pick-up coils allows the simultaneous measurement of both the
      longitudinal and transverse magnetization curves, as is often
      done with Kerr magnetometry.[32] Unless otherwise
      specifically stated, all magnetization data were taken at
      room temperature. The magnetization curve of a 500 &Aring;
      thick NiFe film grown on MgO (001) and Si (not shown) shows
      that H<sub>b</sub> applied during deposition induces a
      uniaxial anisotropy in the NiFe. The value of the uniaxial
      anisotropy is determined from the hard axis saturation field,
      H<sub>s</sub>, to be K<sub>u</sub> = 2000 erg/cm<sup>3</sup>
      given that H<sub>s</sub> = 2K<sub>u</sub>/M<sub>s</sub> in
      the polycrystalline NiFe film. In addition to K<sub>u</sub>
      we also observe a four-fold magnetocrystalline anisotropy in
      the epitaxial NiFe film of about K<sub>1</sub> = -500
      erg/cm<sup>3</sup> (H<sub>s</sub> = 2(K<sub>u</sub>
      +K<sub>1</sub>)/M<sub>s</sub> for a (110) hard axis in the
      (001) plane). These values are consistent with those expected
      for NiFe films.[33]
