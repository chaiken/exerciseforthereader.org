      Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>
      Exchange anisotropy refers to the effect that an
      antiferromagnetic (AF) layer grown in contact with a
      ferromagnetic (FM) layer has on the magnetic response of the
      FM layer.[1] Exchange anisotropy is one of several magnetic
      interfacial interactions, which include interlayer coupling
      in multilayers, that have been intensively studied in recent
      years. The most notable changes in the FM hysteresis loop due
      to the surface exchange coupling are a coercivity enhanced
      over the value typically observed in films grown on a
      nonmagnetic substrate, and a shift in the hysteresis loop of
      the ferromagnet away from the zero field axis. The
      characteristics of the AF layer and the interface between the
      two layers that produce the strongest exchange bias are not
      well understood. Experimental studies and theoretical
      models[2-5] indicate that intrinsic magnetic properties of
      the AF such as the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, exchange
      stiffness and crystalline texture,[6-9] as well as extrinsic
      properties such as grain size, domain size and interface
      roughness[8,10,11] may influence the resulting response of
      the FM. Unfortunately, it is difficult to manipulate these
      properties independently, or to probe the magnetic structure
      of the bilayer interface directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exchange couples which incorporate FeMn, NiMn, PdMn, IrMn,
      Pd-Pt-Mn, NiO, and NiCoO antiferromagnetic layers are
      currently under study for use in magnetoresistive sensors and
      magnetoresistive and spin-valve-based hard disk readback
      heads.[12] The exchange anisotropy is employed to achieve the
      optimum sensitivity in the sensor and to reduce noise by
      stabilizing domains.[13-15] In this paper we focus on the
      oxide AF materials which share the same rocksalt crystal
      structure. The AF spin configurations and exchange coupling
      properties of the Mn-based materials are significantly
      different from the oxide materials and thus must be
      considered separately. The oxide films proposed for
      applications are polycrystalline with relatively small grain
      sizes. Achieving a clearer understanding of how
      magnetocrystalline anisotropy and texture influence the
      exchange anisotropy, however, requires that films with a high
      degree of crystalline perfection be examined as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically NiFe is deposited on top of NiO to form a NiFe/NiO
      exchange couple. A field of 20 to 200 Oe is applied during
      deposition to induce a uniaxial anisotropy in the NiFe layer.
      The interaction of the aligned NiFe spins at the interface
      with the NiO during deposition influences the AF spins in the
      NiO since the applied field is too weak to induce ordering in
      the NiO spins directly. In turn the NiO spin arrangement
      stores the exchange bias information and induces a
      unidirectional surface anisotropy in the NiFe. Heating
      bilayers above the blocking temperature T<sub>b</sub> and
      cooling in a field has been variously reported to
      increase[16] and to decrease[13,17] interfacial exchange
      field H<sub>E</sub> relative to the as-deposited values. How
      the magnitude of the deposition field or the cooling field
      influences H<sub>E</sub> has not been well established in the
      case of oxide antiferromagnets,[18] although a striking
      change of sign in the exchange bias field has been observed
      with large deposition fields in the Fe/FeF<sub>2</sub>
      system.[19]
    </p>
    <p>
      The NiO spin structure is relatively simple, however the
      large number of domain configurations and domain walls in a
      multidomain sample make theoretical models of exchange
      anisotropy in NiO/NiFe bilayers considerably more
      challenging.[20-23] NiO has a cubic FCC NaCl crystal
      structure above its N&eacute;el temperature T<sub>N</sub>.
      Below the N&eacute;el temperature there is a slight
      distortion of the NiO lattice in a (111) direction (Delta l/l
      = 4.5x10<sup>-3</sup>).[24] A strong negative uniaxial
      anisotropy accompanies the contraction, resulting in an easy
      plane defined by K<sub>1</sub> approximately 10<sup>6</sup>
      erg/cm<sup>3</sup>.[23] Sheets of ferromagnetically aligned
      spins form in the (111) planes defined by the contraction
      axis,[21] the Ni spins in neighboring sheets oppositely
      aligned. Within a (111) plane the direction of the spin axis
      is determined by a second 3-fold anisotropy (K<sub>3</sub>)
      that is roughly three orders of magnitude weaker than
      K<sub>1</sub>.[24,25]
    </p>
    <p>
      The AF domain configurations in NiO have been studied both
      experimentally and theoretically. There are four possible
      (111) directions in a NiO crystal from which the contraction
      axis may choose, and 3 spin directions once the contraction
      axis is defined. Thus there are 4x3 = 12 distinct possible AF
      domain configurations in NiO below T<sub>N</sub>. Since the
      four (111) directions in the cubic NiO are nominally
      equivalent, local inhomogeneities break the symmetry and
      determine which (111) axis becomes the contraction axis in
      different regions of the crystal. External applied magnetic
      fields and strain can make one (111) direction more
      kinetically favorable, and thereby influence the distribution
      of AF domains. The magnetic susceptibility of the NiO is
      largest parallel to the contraction axis (and perpendicular
      to the planes of spins), so this axis tends to align parallel
      to strong applied fields.[26] Once the sample temperature has
      been lowered below the N&eacute;el temperature, domain walls
      become strongly pinned[22,26,27] and extremely large fields
      are required to change the AF domain configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this study, we compare the magnetic properties of
      polycrystalline and epitaxial (001) NiO/NiFe bilayers
      deposited simultaneously. We also compare epitaxial (001)
      NiO/NiFe bilayers with the deposition bias field,
      H<sub>b</sub>, aligned along different in-plane NiO
      crystalline axes. The results of these studies are
      interpreted in terms of induced anisotropies at the NiO/NiFe
      interface.
