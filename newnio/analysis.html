    <p>
      In order to model the field dependence of the NiFe
      magnetization, we start by defining the simplest energy
      equation that contains only a unidirectional anisotropy term
      and a Zeeman term describing interaction with the external
      field. We proceed by assuming the magnetization reverses by
      coherent rotation, and that the anisotropy at the interface
      remains constant during NiFe reversal. Recent results,
      however, using a <a href="/alison/niorapid/">magnetooptic
      indicator film technique</a>[36] and Kerr microscopy[37]
      indicate the magnetization in these films reverses by
      incoherent rotation for fields applied along the hard axis
      and through nucleation and growth of domain walls, for fields
      applied along the easy axis. The coherent rotation approach,
      however, gives an understanding of the basic anisotropies
      involved and establishes a framework for us to discuss these
      more complex reversal mechanisms. The energy equation takes
      the form:
    </p>
    <p>
      E/M = -H cos(theta) - H<sub>E</sub> cos(theta - &oslash;) (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      where H<sub>E</sub> is the effective unidirectional
      anisotropy field, &oslash; is the angle between the bias
      field H<sub>b</sub> and the applied field H, and theta is the
      angle between H and the magnetization.[1] (This form ignores
      the induced uniaxial anisotropy in the NiFe layer, which is
      small compared to H<sub>E</sub>.) Assuming the magnetization
      reorients by rotation following the minimum energy solution,
      the hard axis magnetization is:
    </p>
    <p>
      M(H)/M<sub>s</sub> = H/sqrt(H*H +
      H<sub>E</sub>*H<sub>E</sub>) (2)
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these assumptions, the easy axis magnetization should
      have zero coercivity and change sign at H = H<sub>E</sub>,
      and the hard axis magnetization should approach saturation
      asymptotically. The best fit of equation 2 to the measured
      hard axis magnetization for the polycrystalline film in <a
      href="/alison/newnio/fig3.html">figure 3a</a> predicts
      H<sub>E</sub> = 83 Oe which is inconsistent with the measured
      easy axis value of H<sub>E</sub> = 52 Oe. By increasing the
      size of uniaxial anisotropy above the usual value for soft
      NiFe alloys, we can consistently model the easy and hard axis
      behavior observed in figure 3a, and 4a, and qualitatively
      account for the easy-axis coercivity:
    </p>
    <p>
      E/M = -H cos(theta) - H<sub>E</sub> cos(theta - &oslash;) +
      H<sub>K</sub>cos<sup>2</sup>(theta - &oslash;) (3)
    </p>
    <p>
      The predicted analytical form of M(H) is complicated.
      However, the easy and hard axis behavior can now be modelled
      with H<sub>E</sub> = 53 Oe and H<sub>K</sub> = 30 Oe, given
      that equation 3 predicts that the hard-axis magnetization
      curve approaches saturation with H<sub>s</sub> approximately
      equals 2(H<sub>E</sub> + H<sub>K</sub>). The uniaxial term is
      significantly larger than that observed in films of NiFe
      without bias layers (H<sub>K</sub> of NiFe = 5 Oe).[33] The
      increase of H<sub>K</sub> is a manifestation of the
      interfacial interaction with the NiO. Uniaxial strain induced
      at the NiO/NiFe interface may be a source of uniaxial
      anisotropy, however, the small saturation magnetostriction
      expected for this composition of permalloy, combined with the
      small tetragonal distortion of the NiO below its N&eacute;el
      temperature make this an unlikely explanation for the large
      uniaxial anisotropy observed here.[10]
    </p>
    <p>
      The large uniaxial term in the energy equation needed to
      consistently model the easy and hard axis data helps to
      account for the coercivity in the easy axis loop. It is well
      known that, in the presence of a uniaxial term, the energy
      equation contains local energy minima in addition to global
      minima for a range of applied fields.[38,39] Local energy
      minima can pin the magnetization and temporarily delay the
      obtainment of the absolute energy minimum configuration.
      Assuming the NiFe moment in the biased bilayers reverses by
      rotation and follows the local energy minimum, the easy axis
      coercivity predicted by equation 3 is H<sub>ce</sub> =
      H<sub>K</sub> = 30 Oe. In unbiased NiFe films, however,
      H<sub>ce</sub> &lt; H<sub>K</sub> indicating the reversal
      occurs through domain wall motion rather than rotation. The
      easy axis energy surfaces predicted by equation 1 for biased
      NiFe films do not contain local minima, unlike the energy
      surfaces described by equation 3 for biased films. Thus
      equation 3 containing uniaxial and unidirectional anisotropy
      terms is more consistent with the NiFe behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is interesting to note that the ratio of the H<sub>E</sub>
      to H<sub>ce</sub> for a wide range of IBS polycrystalline
      NiO/NiFe bilayers appears to have a characteristic maximum
      value. <a href="/alison/newnio/fig6.html">Figure 6</a> shows
      H<sub>E</sub> plotted vs. H<sub>ce</sub>. The dotted line is
      a guide to the eye showing H<sub>E</sub> = 1.8 H<sub>ce</sub>
      + 14 Oe. <a href="/alison/newnio/fig6.html">Fig. 6</a>
      implies that increases in H<sub>E</sub> and H<sub>ce</sub>
      are correlated in the best polycrystalline NiO/NiFe bilayers
      and are thus different manifestations of the same surface
      anisotropy. On the other hand, films with small H<sub>E</sub>
      and large H<sub>ce</sub> occur since there are many sources
      of coercivity in thin NiFe films, many not directly related
      to the surface exchange interaction. H<sub>E</sub> to
      H<sub>ce</sub> ratios for NiO/NiFe bilayers published in the
      literature[13,16] deposited using reactive sputtering are
      approximately 2.2, which are similar to the values observed
      in the IBS films. More recently, H<sub>E</sub> to
      H<sub>ce</sub> ratios of 9 have been reported in NiO/NiFe
      bilayers with carefully controlled interfacial roughness.[40]
    </p>
    <p>
      The slope of the line in <a href=
      "/alison/newnio/fig6.html">figure 6</a> depends on the
      intrinsic anisotropies present in NiO. The
      H<sub>E</sub>/H<sub>ce</sub> ratios we observe in IBS-grown
      NiFe/NiCoO bilayers typically lie above this line. Further, a
      typical H<sub>E</sub>/H<sub>ce</sub> ratio for NiFe/FeMn
      bilayers is 25.[6] The higher ratio observed in general in
      Mn-based AF exchange couples may be due to the higher
      magnetocrystalline anisotropy or the reduced symmetry of the
      Mn-based antiferromagnets.[6,13] These differences produce a
      interface anisotropy that is more closely described by a pure
      unidirectional in FeMn/NiFe bilayers compared to the
      unidirectional plus uniaxial anisotropy found in NiO/NiFe
      bilayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning now to the magnetization observed in the epitaxial
      bilayers in figures <a href="/alison/newnio/fig3.html">3b</a>
      and <a href="/alison/newnio/fig4.html">4b</a>, the shape of
      the hard-axis magnetization curves can be predicted by adding
      a cubic anisotropy to the energy equation (1):
    </p>
    <p>
      H<sub>k1</sub>cos<sup>2</sup>(theta -
      &oslash;)sin<sup>2</sup>(theta - &oslash;)(4)
    </p>
    <p>
      The data in figure 3b are reasonably well reproduced with
      H<sub>E</sub> = 20 Oe , H<sub>K1</sub> = 30 Oe. The cubic
      anisotropy produces an energy minimum perpendicular to the
      unidirectional anisotropy (and to H<sub>b</sub>) which
      qualitatively changes the hard axis loop shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the presence of a cubic anisotropy produces
      local energy minima in the energy surface describing the
      bilayer magnetization reversal. As discussed previously,
      these minima can be used to qualitatively account for the
      coercivity observed in the hard axis magnetization loop.
      Qualitatively, as H decreases from a large positive value,
      the NiFe layer moment at first remains in a local energy
      minimum parallel to H, and then shifts suddenly from that
      minimum to the energy minimum derived from the unidirectional
      anisotropy term, perpendicular to H and parallel to
      H<sub>b</sub>. Transverse magnetization data (Fig. <a href=
      "/alison/newnio/fig3.html">3c</a>, <a href=
      "/alison/newnio/fig4.html">4c</a>) for H perpendicular to
      H<sub>b</sub> reinforce this description. As the longitudinal
      magnetization (M<sub>x</sub>) decreases, the transverse
      magnetization (M<sub>y</sub>) increases abruptly and reaches
      a plateau as the NiFe layer moment settles into the global
      energy minimum perpendicular to H. This is in contrast to the
      transverse hard-axis behavior of the polycrystalline bilayer
      couple which shows a smooth rotation of the NiFe layer moment
      and no plateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculated magnetization curves that qualitatively reproduce
      the experimental data for the epitaxial bilayers are shown in
      <a href="/alison/newnio/fig7.html">figure 7a,b.</a> The
      curves were calculated using an energy equation with a
      unidirectional and a cubic anisotropy:
    </p>
    <p>
      E/(M*H<sub>E</sub>) = -H/H<sub>E</sub>cos(theta) - cos(theta
      - &oslash;) + H<sub>K1</sub>cos<sup>2</sup>(theta -
      &oslash;)sin<sup>2</sup>(theta - &oslash;) (5)
    </p>
    <p>
      where H<sub>K1</sub>/H<sub>E</sub> = 1.5. The magnetization
      in <a href="/alison/newnio/fig7.html">figure 7a</a> is
      assumed to reverse by rotation and to find the absolute
      minimum energy configuration. The calculation reproduces the
      steps observed in the epitaxial hard axis loops. As in the
      case of the polycrystalline bilayers, if we assume the vector
      magnetization sticks in local energy minima and only achieves
      the absolute minimum when its path is unobstructed by an
      energy barrier, we can qualitatively account for the
      coercivity observed in the easy and hard axis loops as shown
      in <a href="/alison/newnio/fig7.html">figure 7b</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the similarity of the hard axis loops in figure <a href=
      "/alison/newnio/fig3.html">3b,c</a> and <a href=
      "/alison/newnio/fig4.html">4b,c</a>, where the bias field is
      applied along a different NiO crystal axis, it is clear that
      the cubic term is induced by the bias field applied during
      deposition, and is not referenced to the NiO or the NiFe
      crystal axes. Thus the data are not consistent with a
      magneto-crystalline anisotropy in the NiFe or the NiO. In
      contrast, epitaxial NiFe films deposited directly on MgO
      (001) show induced bulk uniaxial and cubic magnetocrystalline
      anisotropy terms which are nearly an order of magnitude
      smaller than those needed to describe the NiO/NiFe loops. The
      cubic anisotropy must arise from the same interfacial
      interaction with the NiO that produces the exchange
      anisotropy. We speculate that the reduced disorder at the
      epitaxial NiO surface relative to the polycrystalline NiO
      surface allows a more coherent response of the NiO spin
      configuration to the alignment of the NiFe grown on top of
      it. Ferromagnetic resonance or Brillouin light-scattering
      measurements on these bilayer films may give a more
      quantitative determination of the anisotropy values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our analysis treats the NiFe as an isolated layer under the
      influence of a static surface anisotropy produced by the NiO
      interface. This analysis implies that the spin configuration
      in the NiO layer undergoes reversible dynamics only during
      the reversal of the NiFe moment, which is incorrect strictly
      speaking. The observation of a training effect and the
      presence of rotational hysteresis in NiFe/NiO bilayers even
      at very high applied fields[41] clearly show that some
      irreversible NiO wall motions occur during a NiFe reversal.
      However, a static induced surface anisotropy does describe
      many of the main features of the NiFe/NiO magnetization
      curves. The contributions of irreversible NiO spin dynamics
      on the NiFe loop are secondary effects in these experiments.
      Additional experimental work is needed to measure and
      understand the NiO wall motion during the NiFe magnetization
      reversal process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again it is interesting to compare the behavior of
      NiFe/NiO and NiFe/FeMn exchange couples. As with NiO/NiFe
      exchange couples, there is a strong deposition order
      dependence in NiFe/FeMn exchange couples. However, in the
      FeMn case it is the NiFe that should be deposited first in
      order to achieve a large exchange bias.[45] The order
      dependence of NiFe/FeMn exchange bias has been found to arise
      from changes in growth mode when the order of deposition is
      reversed. The (111) textured NiFe surface serves as a
      template for the antiferromagnetic gamma phase of FeMn. In
      the absence of the NiFe template the FeMn does not achieve
      the gamma phase and instead forms in the nonmagnetic alpha
      phase, and no exchange bias is observed. In experiments where
      the gamma FeMn is stabilized through epitaxy with a single
      crystal substrate, exchange bias is observed in NiFe
      deposited on top.[6] Further, when the gamma FeMn was grown
      in different crystalline orientations, exchange bias in the
      NiFe grown on top was observed in every case.[6] The ratio of
      H<sub>E</sub> to H<sub>ce</sub> for the FeMn/NiFe bilayers
      was different for the different crystalline orientations,
      however.[6] Features in the magnetization loops associated
      with uniaxial or cubic anisotropies in addition to the
      unidirectional anisotropy in epitaxial FeMn/NiFe bilayers
      were not reported. Changing the order of NiO/NiFe bilayer
      deposition does not change the crystalline phases of the
      individual layers, but instead produces changes in growth
      mode that lead to differences in the exchange anisotropy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would like to discuss one final experimental fact we
      observed in NiO/NiFe bilayers, and that is the large exchange
      bias observed in as-deposited bilayers. Exchange bias in
      as-deposited film is also observed in NiFe/FeMn bilayers.
      Since bilayers are nominally deposited at room temperature,
      one might predict that as-deposited films would not exibit
      exchange bias until they were heated above T<sub>b</sub> and
      cooled in a field. The presence of exchange bias in
      as-deposited films implies that the temperature of the
      growing film exceeds T<sub>b</sub> during the deposition. In
      order to test this hypothesis, we deposited NiO/NiFe bilayers
      on substrates clamped to a thick Cu plate that was cooled to
      -120&deg;C. Large loop shifts H<sub>E</sub> were still
      observed in these films. It is likely that even when the
      substrates are cooled from the back side, the energy
      transported to the film surface by the deposited material
      raises the surface temperature of the growing film above
      T<sub>b</sub>. A more effective test of the above hypothesis
      would be to employ a low energy NiFe deposition technique
      such as evaporation in conjunction with substrate cooling. In
      an all metal system such as NiFe/FeMn, where the thermal
      conductivity is higher, maintaining a film temperature below
      T<sub>b</sub> during deposition may be more straightforward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our observations on epitaxial oxide-AF/NiFe exchange-coupled
      bilayers are consistent with the unpublished data of Carey
      <strong>et al.</strong> who did extensive characterization of
      exchange couples using epitaxial NiO, NiCoO films and NiO/CoO
      multilayers grown by reactive magnetron sputtering.[42] They
      report consistently smaller H<sub>E</sub> in epitaxial
      relative to polycrystalline bilayers deposited under similar
      conditions. They also observe exchange anisotropy in both
      (111) and (001) oriented epitaxial bilayers, with
      consistently larger coercivity in the (111) relative to the
      (001) oriented films. Lai <strong>et al.</strong>[43] report
      loop shifts in bilayers with epitaxial (001) and (111) NiO
      films grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition
      (MOCVD). They observe unusually large and nearly isotropic
      coercivity in both (001) and (111) oriented MOCVD based
      bilayer couples, however. van der Zaag <em>et al.</em> have
      experimentally demonstrated the occurrence of exchange
      biasing in compensated epitaxial (100)
      Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CoO multilayers.[9]
