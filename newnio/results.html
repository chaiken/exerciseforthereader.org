      Hysteresis loops of a NiO(500&Aring;)/NiFe(100&Aring;)
      bilayer couple measured below and above the NiO blocking
      temperature, T<sub>b</sub>, are shown in <a href=
      "/alison/newnio/fig1.html">Figure 1</a> and illustrate the
      effects of the interface exchange interaction. Above the
      blocking temperature (T<sub>b</sub> = 200&deg;C &lt;
      T<sub>N</sub> = 240&deg;C), the NiO spins are thermally
      fluctuating and the NiFe film shows evidence only of its
      usual induced uniaxial anisotropy. The NiFe film has an easy
      axis coercivity of about H<sub>ce</sub> = 2 Oe, and a hard
      axis saturation field (not shown) of about H<sub>s</sub> = 5
      Oe. After cooling to room temperature in an external magnetic
      field, the NiO spins are frozen and the interfacial magnetic
      interaction induces a unidirectional anisotropy on the NiFe
      film which shifts the NiFe hysteresis loops away from the
      zero field axis by an amount H<sub>E</sub>. The direction of
      the shift depends on the orientation of the NiFe layer
      magnetization during field cooling. In addition to the loop
      shift, the interfacial interaction increases the coercivity
      dramatically. Perpendicular to the loop shift direction, the
      hard axis loop (not shown) passes nearly linearly through
      zero with almost no coercivity. The 1/t<sub>NiFe</sub>
      thickness dependence of H<sub>E</sub> and H<sub>ce</sub>
      expected from the interfacial origin of these effects, is
      well established.[13]
    </p>
    <p>
      A comparison of the XRD spectra for NiO/NiFe bilayers grown
      simultaneously on MgO (001) and oxidized silicon is shown on
      <a href="/alison/newnio/fig2.html">Figure 2</a>. The films
      deposited on oxidized Si wafers are polycrystalline as shown
      by the presence of (111), (002) and (022) NiO Bragg peaks.
      The average grain size calculated using the Scherrer formula
      from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peaks is
      100&Aring; to 200&Aring;. Because the NiO and MgO crystal
      structures are nearly identical with only slightly different
      lattice parameters, (MgO: a = 4.213&Aring;, NiO: a =
      4.177&Aring; or 0.9% difference) the NiO (002) Bragg peak of
      the film on MgO is obscured under the strong substrate peak.
      No NiO (111) or (022) Bragg peak intensity was observed in
      the XRD spectra of the bilayer grown on MgO, however. Instead
      a strong (002) peak from the NiFe deposited on the NiO was
      present with a correlation length limited by the thickness of
      the film (100&Aring;) and a rocking curve width of
      1&deg;-2&deg; FWHM. Phi scans at the NiFe (011) peak position
      show that the NiFe layer grown on top of the NiO layer is
      epitaxially oriented relative to the MgO substrate (<a href=
      "/alison/newnio/fig2.html">Figure 2b</a>). The epitaxy of the
      NiFe shows that the intermediate NiO layer is also oriented
      in-plane with respect to the MgO substrate. As discussed in
      the previous section, NiFe films grown directly on MgO (001)
      were also found to be epitaxial. Comparison of Kiessig
      fringes in the low-angle symmetric XRD spectra (not shown)
      indicate that the interfaces of the epitaxial bilayer are
      rougher (8-12 &Aring; rms) than the polycrystalline bilayer
      (2-3 &Aring; rms).
    </p>
    <p>
      The hysteresis loops of polycrystalline and epitaxial NiO
      (500&Aring;)/NiFe (100&Aring;) bilayers grown simultaneously
      are shown in <a href="/alison/newnio/fig3.html">Figure 3</a>.
      In the epitaxial film the bias field during deposition
      H<sub>b</sub> was applied along an MgO [100] axis. Hysteresis
      loops parallel and perpendicular to H<sub>b</sub> are shown.
      The polycrystalline bilayer (<a href=
      "/alison/newnio/fig3.html">Fig. 3a</a>) illustrates the usual
      exchange anisotropy behavior: there is a shift in the easy
      axis hysteresis loop of H<sub>E</sub> = 52 Oe and an increase
      in the NiFe coercivity from its free value of about
      H<sub>ce</sub> = 2 Oe to H<sub>ce</sub> = 30 Oe. The hard
      axis loop shows almost zero coercivity and saturates at about
      2H<sub>E</sub>. The loop parallel to H<sub>b</sub> for the
      epitaxial bilayer (<a href="/alison/newnio/fig3.html">Fig.
      3b</a>) shows a shift of H<sub>E</sub> = 20 Oe and a
      coercivity of H<sub>ce</sub> = 26 Oe. The shape of the hard
      axis magnetization (perpendicular to H<sub>b</sub> ) in the
      epitaxial film is qualitatively different from the nearly
      linear hard axis loop observed in the polycrystalline films.
      <a href="/alison/newnio/fig3.html">Figure 3c</a> shows
      transverse magnetization data for the polycrystalline and
      epitaxial films with H perpendicular to H<sub>b</sub>,and
      indicates the nonlinearity in the epitaxial bilayer's hard
      axis loop is due to a nearly 90&deg; reorientation of the
      magnetization vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <a href="/alison/newnio/fig4.html">figure 4</a> another
      set of magnetization data for polycrystalline and epitaxial
      NiO/NiFe bilayers grown simultaneously is shown but now with
      H<sub>b</sub>, the bias field applied during deposition,
      aligned with an in-plane MgO [110] axis. The polycrystalline
      bilayer (<a href="/alison/newnio/fig4.html">Fig. 4a</a>) has
      an exchange field of H<sub>E</sub> = 66 Oe and an easy-axis
      coercivity of H<sub>ce</sub> = 34 Oe. The hard axis loop once
      again saturates at about H<sub>s</sub> = 2H<sub>E</sub> and
      has coercivity less than 1 Oe. The epitaxial bilayer (<a
      href="/alison/newnio/fig4.html">Fig. 4b</a>) has
      H<sub>E</sub> = 36 Oe, and H<sub>ce</sub> = 42 Oe. The hard
      axis magnetization data shown in <a href=
      "/alison/newnio/fig4.html">figure 4b and 4c</a> shows similar
      behavior to that seen in <a href=
      "/alison/newnio/fig3.html">figure 3b and 3c</a>. The
      similarity between figure 3b and 4b reveals that the
      nonlinearity observed in the hard axis magnetization curves
      of the epitaxial films is induced by H<sub>b</sub> and is not
      referenced to the underlying crystal structure of the NiO.
      The variation in H<sub>E</sub> for the polycrystalline
      samples shown in <a href="/alison/newnio/fig3.html">figures
      3a</a> and <a href="/alison/newnio/fig4.html">4a</a> results
      from uncontrolled variations in the deposition conditions and
      serves as a measure of the run-to-run reproducibility of the
      growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have grown epitaxial bilayers in reverse order to better
      understand why this configuration typically shows lower
      exchange anisotropy than do bilayers with NiO on the
      bottom.[34] <a href="/alison/newnio/fig5.html">Figure 5</a>
      shows easy axis magnetization loops for NiFe 100&Aring;/NiO
      500&Aring; bilayers grown simultaneously on oxidized silicon
      and MgO (001) substrates. In this configuration the choice of
      substrate has much less effect on the hysteresis loop. The
      exchange shift is H<sub>E</sub> = 13 Oe and H<sub>ce</sub> =
      5 Oe in both films. XRD shows that both NiO films are
      polycrystalline. These data demonstrate that the growth mode
      of NiO on NiFe is significantly different than that of NiFe
      on NiO, which explains the difference in the exchange
      anisotropy observed in the two configurations. Recently,
      however, large bias fields (0.04 erg/cm<sup>3</sup>) were
      reported in ``top'' spin valves grown with the NiO layer on
      top of a NiFe layer using reactive RF sputtering.[35]
