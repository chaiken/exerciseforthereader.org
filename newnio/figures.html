      1:</strong></a> Hysteresis loops of the same polycrystalline
      NiO500&Aring;/NiFe100&Aring;\ bilayer film are shown, one at
      a temperature below the blocking temperature, T <sub>b</sub>,
      of NiO and one above T <sub>b</sub>. Above T <sub>b</sub>,
      the NiFe behaves as a free layer, magnetically the same as a
      NiFe layer deposited on a non-magnetic substrate. Below T
      <sub>b</sub> the interfacial exchange interaction induces a
      unidirectional anisotropy which shifts the NiFe loop away
      from the zero field axis and raises its coercivity.

      2:</strong></a> Comparison of x-ray spectra from NiO
      500&Aring;/NiFe 100&Aring; bilayer films deposited
      simultaneously on polished single crystal MgO (001) and
      oxidized Si substrates. The bottom scan in a) shows that the
      NiO on the oxidized silicon substrate is polycrystalline with
      a grain size of approximately 150&Aring;. The top scan shows
      the NiO (111) and (022) Bragg peaks are absent in the bilayer
      grown on MgO. The MgO (002) substrate peak obscures the
      presence of the NiO (002) peak. A strong reflection is
      present from the NiFe (001) planes. In b), phi scans at the
      NiFe (022) and the MgO (022) Bragg angles are shown. The NiFe
      layer is epitaxially oriented relative to the MgO substrate,
      confirming that the NiO layer is also epitaxial.

      3:</strong></a> Magnetization data for two NiO
      500&Aring;/NiFe 100&Aring;\ bilayer films deposited
      simultaneously. In a) the easy-axis (H parallel to H
      <sub>b</sub>, the bias field during growth) and hard-axis (H
      perpendicular to H <sub>b</sub>) magnetization curves of the
      polycrystalline bilayer couple is shown. The easy-axis loop
      is shifted by H <sub>E</sub> = 52 Oe due to interfacial
      exchange anisotropy with the NiO. b) shows the same
      measurement as in a) for an epitaxial (001) bilayer deposited
      on MgO. The bias field, H <sub>b</sub>, applied during
      deposition was aligned parallel to an in-plane MgO (100)
      axis. The easy-axis loop is shifted by H <sub>E</sub> = 20
      Oe. Discontinuities in the hard-axis loop reveal the present
      of a cubic induced anisotropy term that produces a local
      energy minimum parallel to the applied field and
      perpendicular to H <sub>b</sub>. In c) the transverse hard
      axis magnetization, M <sub>y</sub>, for the polycrystalline
      (open circles) and epitaxial (filled circles) are compared.
      The smooth curve of the polycrystalline M <sub>y</sub> loop
      shows the magnetization vector rotates continuously as the
      applied field varies. The plateau in the epitaxial M
      <sub>y</sub> loop confirms that the NiFe moment turns
      discontinuously from a local energy minimum parallel to the
      applied field to the deep unidirectional minimum
      perpendicular to it.

      <a href="/alison/newnio/fig4.html"><strong>Figure
      4:</strong></a> The same measurements as shown in figure 3
      for a second set of simultaneously deposited polycrystalline
      and epitaxial bilayers except that here H <sub>b</sub>, the
      bias field during deposition, was applied parallel to an
      in-plane (110) axis. For the polycrystalline films in a) the
      easy-axis loop is shifted by H <sub>E</sub> = 66 Oe. In b)
      the epitaxial film has H <sub>E</sub> = 36 Oe. c) shows the
      transverse hard axis magnetization loops. The data are
      qualitatively similar to those in figure 3, particularly the
      observation of discontinuities indicating a cubic anisotropy
      with minima referenced to the bias field axis. Thus the cubic
      anisotropy is induced by the bias field and is not influenced
      by the orientation of H <sub>b</sub> relative to the NiO
      crystal axis.

      <a href="/alison/newnio/fig5.html"><strong>Figure
      5:</strong></a> Easy axis magnetization for two bilayer films
      deposited in reverse order simultaneously on MgO and an
      oxidized silicon substrate. Both NiO layers grown on NiFe
      were polycrystalline. The exchange bias fields and
      coercivities of the two films are the same. Differences in
      the growth of NiO on NiFe compared to NiFe on NiO lead to the
      reduced exchange anisotropy observed in these films.

      <a href="/alison/newnio/fig6.html"><strong>Figure
      6:</strong></a> The exchange anisotropy field, H <sub>E</sub>
      for a wide variety of NiO-500&Aring;/NiFe-t <sub>NiFe</sub>
      films plotted vs. the easy-axis coercivity, H <sub>ce</sub>.
      The dotted line is a guide to the eye indicating the
      relationship H <sub>E</sub> = 1.8 H <sub>ce</sub> + 14 Oe, so
      the H <sub>E</sub> to H <sub>ce</sub> ratio has a limiting
      value of about 1.8. This value appears to be a characteristic
      of the AF material since the ratio observed for NiCoO/NiFe
      bilayers typically exceeds this value. AF/NiFe bilayers using
      Mn-based antiferromagnetic layers greatly exceed this value,
      giving much less coercivity per unit exchange anisotropy
      shift.

      (solid) magnetization loops using an energy equation with a

      configuration. In b) we assume the magnetization remains in
      local minima until the path to the absolute minimum is
      unobstructed by an energy barrier. The calculations
