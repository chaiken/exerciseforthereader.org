    <p>
      The first consideration when undertaking critical field
      measurements on anisotropic samples is how to mount the
      specimens. High anisotropy, the property of central interest,
      unfortunately presents the investigator with special
      problems. In a nutshell, the larger the anisotropy, the
      greater are the errors induced by small misalignments. Since
      most of the experiments in the present work were done on
      HOPG-derived polycrystals, the only concern relevant to
      alignment was the careful orientation of the crystalline
      c-axis with respect to the applied magnetic field. Due to the
      samples' air sensitivity, they had to be preserved inside
      sealed glass tubes. Therefore alignment in practice meant
      fixing the orientation of the GIC with respect to the glass
      tube. Early critical field results were found to be
      unreliable due to the fact that the samples were mobile
      inside the glass tubes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The obvious tack to take in mounting the samples was to use
      the technique employed by Iye and Tanuma.[<a href=
      "node66.html#iye82">120</a>] These workers wrapped their
      GIC's in Parafilm, a kind of wax paper manufactured by Union
      Carbide, and took the sample thus wrapped out of their
      glovebox directly to a coldfinger, where it was immediately
      mounted and cooled down. Unfortunately in the present case
      the available cryostat and glovebox were separated by a great
      distance, so this transfer method was thought to be
      infeasible. Also, this method presents difficulties for
      preserving the sample upon warming to room temperature, and
      it is desirable to save the samples for repetition of
      experiments. Therefore it was decided that the specimens
      would have to be always encapsulated in glass tubes for
      handling and transfer. The idea of wrapping the sample in
      Parafilm in order to fix its position within the glass tube
      did not seem to be practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several methods were tried in an effort to fix the samples
      without degrading them. First, it was attempted to hold the
      samples in place by using a gas torch to make an indentation
      of the encapsulating tube around the sample's position,
      trapping it in one orientation. This method was unsuccessful
      due to the deintercalation that the heat of the torch caused.
      The next idea, that of gluing the samples to a holder, was
      discarded because of the extreme chemical reactivity of
      alkali metal compounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Success was finally achieved by mounting the specimens on
      specially made metal holders whose general features are
      sketched in Figure <a href="node25.html#figholder"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. In this method, sheets
      of copper or brass were cut into pieces of such a width that
      they fit tightly into the appropriate size of glass tube.
      Copper and brass were chosen because their high thermal
      conductivity should prevent the development of a temperature
      gradient across the samples at the very low temperatures used
      in the superconductivity studies. Also, these metals are
      neither superconducting nor ferromagnetic, and so produce no
      temperature-dependent inductive signal to compete with that
      from the superconducting transition. After the metal pieces
      were cut, they were cleaned with a weak solution of
      hydrochloric acid, dipped in a bicarbonate solution to stop
      the acid reaction, and then rinsed in de-ionized water. The
      metal holders were then heated under to vacuum to remove any
      residual water, and taken into the inert environment of the
      glovebox. (See general comments on handling samples in the
      glovebox in Chapter <a href="node12.html#samprep"><img width=
      "13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>.)

       <strong>Figure:</strong> A sketch of the sample holder used
      in the critical field measurements. The dimension <b>d</b> of
      the metal piece was chosen to be the inner diameter of the
      sample tube so that the holder would be centered and fixed
      inside the tube. A careful effort was made to orient the
      carbon (graphene) planes parallel to the holder's surface.
      The GIC's were affixed to the metal pieces with Apiezon N
      grease.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When the metal holders were first used, the samples were
      attached to them by pressure applied with a folded-over flap
      of metal. This flap was squeezed over the sample with
      tweezers after the sample was placed on top of the metal.
      Half the time this technique was very successful: the sample
      after mounting showed no degradation of its superconducting
      transition or of its (00<i>l</i>) x-ray diffractogram. (See
      Chapter <a href="node12.html#samprep"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> for a discussion of
      staging characterization of GIC's by (00<i>l</i>) x-ray
      diffraction.) The other half of the time, the sample's
      transition temperature was reduced, and its x-ray spectrum
      was either attenuated or completely suppressed, presumably
      due to fracture of the carbon (graphene) planes resulting
      from excess pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the sample attrition rate from this method of
      mounting was unacceptably high, it was decided to try
      attaching the samples to the metal holders with vacuum
      grease. Vacuum grease is considerably more inert than
      commercially available glues, and Apiezon N grease was used
      successfully in mounting C<sub>8</sub>K by Sano and
      coworkers.[<a href="node66.html#sano80">214</a>] In the end,
      the best method of mounting the samples turned out to be
      dabbing grease on one side with a piece of wire, and then
      using the grease to adhere the samples to the metal holder.
      The grease was left overnight in an open container in the
      glovebox before use so that it would outgas. Mounting with
      vacuum grease allowed specimens to be fixed in such a way
      that their T<sub>c</sub> and x-ray spectrum were unaffected,
      and in addition satisfied the goal of keeping the GIC
      stationary even when the sample tube was shaken. The GIC's
      should have been firmly fixed at low temperatures where the
      grease can freeze them to the holder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the GIC's were fixed in their glass tubes, the tubes
      were fixed inside the inductance bridge's primary coil with
      GE 7031 varnish, taking care that the tube's axis was
      parallel to the modulation field direction. This alignment is
      thought to be good to within a degree or so since the walls
      of the tubing and the inside of the coil are both flat. The
      result was that the modulation field was applied in the
      direction perpendicular to the graphite c-axis, where it had
      the least effect on the critical field measurements.
