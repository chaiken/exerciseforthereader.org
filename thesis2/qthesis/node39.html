      Critical field studies on graphite intercalation compounds
      involve several experiments on a number of materials, are
      afflicted by many experimental difficulties, and are
      qualitatively described by a host of difficult microscopic
      theories. A critical review of the facts and speculations of
      the previous sections is in order to draw some conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the experimental standpoint, there are several ways in
      which this project could have been improved. Better cryogenic
      instrumentation would have permitted the collection of more
      accurate data at additional temperatures. Better structural
      characterization as far as crystalline quality and in-plane
      homogeneity would have taken some of the uncertainty out of
      the interpretation of the data. The preparation of single
      crystals of GIC superconductors would allow anisotropy
      studies to be extended to a search for angular dependence of
      H<sub>c2</sub> in the layer planes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) experiments, which were
      affected more by the quality of the crystals than by
      instrumental problems, raised some intriguing questions about
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg. The most interesting question is whether
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg has type I character for small angles
      <i>theta</i>, and the answer seems to be yes, both from the
      critical field and specific heat studies. The other
      unexpected finding is that the angular dependence seems to be
      better described by Tinkham's formula than by the anisotropic
      Ginzburg-Landau model. The reason for the unusual shape of
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) may be understood only if
      angle-dependent demagnetization effects can be accounted for
      in a quantitative way, or perhaps if one of the microscopic
      models of anisotropic superconductivity can be fit to the
      data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important finding of the angular dependence
      experiments is that the magnitude of the linear specific heat
      coefficient, <i>Gamma</i>, found by Alexander <em>et al.</em>
      appears to be too high. One of the most longstanding
      mysteries about GIC's has been why C<sub>4</sub>KHg with N(0)
      = 0.41 states / (eV<i>cdot</i>atom) has a lower T<sub>c</sub>
      than C<sub>8</sub>KHg with N(0) = 0.058 states
      /(eV<i>cdot</i>atom).[<a href=
      "node66.html#alexander81">8</a>] However, the <i>Gamma</i>
      determined from these specific heat measurements predicts
      such high values of H<sub>c</sub>(t) that C<sub>4</sub>KHg
      would be type I for most angles <i>theta</i> (see Table <a
      href="node30.html#htherm_table"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> ), in sharp contrast to the experimental observations.
      The magnitude of H<sub>c</sub>(t) determined from the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) fits is about a factor of 1.8
      lower than the magnitude of H<sub>c</sub>(T) determined from
      Alexander's specific heat data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since in weak-coupling superconductors H<sub>c</sub>
      <i>propto</i> <i>sqrt</i><i>Gamma</i>,[<a href=
      "node66.html#tinkham80">252</a>] and <i>Gamma</i>
      <i>propto</i> N(0), this finding implies that the
      density-of-states measured for C<sub>4</sub>KHg by Alexander
      and colleagues may have been about a factor of 3.2 too high.
      Then the corrected N(0) for C<sub>4</sub>KHg = 0.13
      states/(eV<i>cdot</i>atom). If the further assumption is made
      that the specimen measured by Alexander <em>et al.</em> had a
      T<sub>c</sub> of 0.7 K (they measured only down to 0.8 K, and
      saw no transition), then this N(0) is the phonon-dressed DOS,
      which requires a further division by (1 +
      <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub>) = 1.38. (See Table <a href=
      "node37.html#lambdatable"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      .) Then the final value of N(0) estimated from the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) experiments is 0.094 states/(eV
      <i>cdot</i>atom). This is still higher than the latest number
      for the DOS of C<sub>8</sub>KHg = 0.058 states
      /(eV<i>cdot</i>atom) reported by Alexander,[<a href=
      "node66.html#alexander81">8</a>] but not higher than their
      original estimate of N(0) for C<sub>8</sub>KHg = 0.18 states
      /(eV<i>cdot</i>atom).[<a href=
      "node66.html#alexander80">7</a>] Because C<sub>8</sub>KHg is
      more strongly type II than C<sub>4</sub>KHg,[<a href=
      "node66.html#iye82">120</a>] using the higher value of N(0)
      would not imply type I behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      This extended discussion of the density-of-states issue is
      not meant to produce hard numbers for C<sub>4</sub>KHg or
      C<sub>8</sub>KHg. Rather the point of this inquiry is merely
      to suggest that the ``mystery'' of why C<sub>4</sub>KHg has a
      lower T<sub>c</sub> may not be so mysterious after all. A new
      specific heat measurement on a C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimen with
      a known T<sub>c</sub> would be valuable in clearing up these
      issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The H<sub>c2</sub>(T) measurements were more affected by
      instrumental difficulties than the angular dependence
      experiments. Nonetheless, two interesting anomalies were
      found in the data: evidence for the temperature dependence of
      <i>epsilon</i>, the anisotropy parameter; and enhanced
      linearity of the critical fields. (There is no conflict
      between these two observations because <i>epsilon</i> was
      determined from the more accurate
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) experiments, and the amount of
      change in d H<sub>c2</sub>/dT implied by the variation of
      <i>epsilon</i> is within the error bars of the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(T) measurements.) These two features of the
      temperature dependence contradict the predictions of the AGL
      model, which otherwise describe the data rather well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enhanced linearity of H<sub>c2</sub>(T), temperature
      variation of <i>epsilon</i>, and unexpected fits to Tinkham's
      formula provide motivation for interpreting the data using
      one of the many microscopic models available. There is ample
      justification for doing so considering that the anomalies
      seen in C<sub>4</sub>KHg were observed on a larger scale in
      the other ternaries[<a href="node66.html#iye82">120</a>] and
      the binaries.[<a href="node66.html#koike80">141</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#kobayashi85">133</a>] The most sensible models
      to consider are those that fit the data of the closely
      related transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors well.
      Of these, the models dealing with Fermi surface and energy
      gap anisotropy or multiband effects seem most promising. The
      other enhancement mechanism that seems relevant to GIC's is
      one developed by Carter and coworkers[<a href=
      "node66.html#carter81">34</a>] which incorporates the effects
      of microscopic inhomogeneity. Unfortunately a more complete
      Fermi surface computation is needed for a ternary GIC before
      these theories can directly tested.
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarize the findings discussed in this chapter, let's
      see what general statements can be made about ternary GIC
      superconductors. First of all, they are weak-coupling
      superconductors with <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub> about 0.4,
      which is typical for materials with T<sub>c</sub> on the
      order of 1 K.[<a href="node66.html#mcmillan68">165</a>]
      Orbital pairbreaking is the principal influence on the
      critical fields of GIC's since they have <i>alpha</i>
      10<sup>-3</sup>, and so are not affected by Pauli-limiting
      effects. Several GIC's ( C<sub>8</sub>K, C<sub>8</sub>Rb, and
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg) show signs of type I superconductivity for
      a small angular region around <i>vec</i>H || ^c. Ternary GIC
      superconductors have anisotropy ratios 1/<i>epsilon</i> in
      the range from about 9 to 40, and they are fairly well
      described by the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau model, despite
      some deviations. These deviations, which are outside the
      scope of the AGL model, include a temperature-dependent
      anisotropy and either extended linearity or positive
      curvature of H<sub>c2</sub>(T). All in all, the ternary GIC
      superconductors show great similarity to the TMDC's, the
      principal difference being that the TMDC's are more strongly
      coupled, with higher T<sub>c</sub>'s and larger critical
      fields.

      Figure <a href="node39.html#c6k"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> is offered as a final reminder of how much is unknown
      about superconductivity in graphite intercalation compounds.
      This figure shows the critical fields as a function of
      temperature for the binary GIC's C<sub>8</sub>K and
      C<sub>6</sub>K. C<sub>8</sub>K is the simplest of all the
      superconducting GIC's, and hence should be the first test of
      any proposed model. As has been pointed out many times, the
      very presence of superconductivity in C<sub>8</sub>K is
      something of a mystery since neither of its starting
      constituents is superconducting alone.[<a href=
      "node66.html#takada82">234</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#M143">4</a>] C<sub>8</sub>K has large positive
      curvature of its critical fields, as the figure shows.
      C<sub>6</sub>K is a high-pressure phase of C<sub>8</sub>K
      which shows enhanced linearity rather than positive curvature
      in H<sub>c2</sub>(T).[<a href="node66.html#avdeev87">13</a>]
      In this, and in its T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K,[<a href=
      "node66.html#avdeev87">13</a>] C<sub>6</sub>K is strikingly
      similar to C<sub>4</sub>KHg. The challenge to critical-field
      theorists here is quite clear: explain why the application of
      pressure at the same time increases T<sub>c</sub> tenfold and
      suppresses positive curvature. Until basic questions about
      the prototype GIC superconductor, C<sub>8</sub>K, are
      answered, one can hardly hope to have a complete
      understanding of the much more complex ternary compounds.

    <p>
      It would be a great omission to end a discussion of critical
      fields in anisotropic superconductors without touching on the
      central problem of the underlying cause of critical field
      enhancement in anisotropic materials. Anyone who follows the
      literature on anisotropic superconductors can plainly see
      that nearly all layered materials have extended linearity or
      positive curvature of H<sub>c2</sub>(T), be they artificially
      structured superlattices, high- T<sub>c</sub>
      superconductors, heavy-fermion or organic materials,
      transition metal dichalcogenides and their intercalation
      compounds, or even GIC's. The ubiquity of critical field
      deviation above the WHH theory was previously noted by
      Woollam, Somoano, and O'Connor.[<a href=
      "node66.html#woollam74">267</a>] The mass of accumulated
      evidence forces one to look for a common origin of the
      enhancement in these materials, even though they are each
      described by their own special microscopic models: the
      artificially structured superlattice by Takahashi and
      Tachiki,[<a href="node66.html#takahashi86b">235</a>] the
      heavy-fermion materials by Delong <em>et al.</em>,[<a href=
      "node66.html#delong87">57</a>], the organic compounds and
      TMDCIC's by the KLB model,[<a href=
      "node66.html#klemm75">131</a>] the GIC's and TMDC and Chevrel
      phases by the anisotropic gap/FS or multiband models,[<a
      href="node66.html#butler80">33</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#entel77">81</a>] and the high- T<sub>c</sub>
      superconductors by who-knows-what.[<a href=
      "node66.html#marsiglio87">162</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily a common origin to the enhancement in all these
      materials can be deduced. The key is the juxtaposition of two
      superconducting components, either layers or bands, one of
      which has a high intrinsic critical field, and the other of
      which has a lower intrinsic critical field. Near
      T<sub>c</sub>, where the coherence lengths are large and
      non-local effects are small, the two components are coupled,
      and d H<sub>c2</sub>/dT is determined by both jointly. That
      is, an average sort of critical field results because the
      system is forced to distribute field-induced vortices equally
      over both components. At lower temperatures, the two
      components are more weakly coupled, so that the
      superconductor can concentrate the vortices in the
      intrinsically low- H<sub>c2</sub> component. This component
      is now effectively normal even when H <b>&lt;</b>
      H<sub>c2</sub>, so that the intrinsically high-
      H<sub>c2</sub> portion now determines the upper critical
      field. Once the temperature is low enough that the high-
      H<sub>c2</sub> part decouples from the low- H<sub>c2</sub>
      part, d H<sub>c2</sub>/dT will increase, causing positive
      curvature.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, consider S/N superlattices where one type of
      layer (the N layer) has a low intrinsic H<sub>c2</sub>. Near
      T<sub>c</sub> the vortices, which of characteristic size
      <i>xi</i>(T), are too big to squeeze into the N layer, so
      some average of the diffusivities of the N and S materials
      determines the slope of H<sub>c2</sub>. At lower temperatures
      where vortices can fit into the N layers, those layers
      effectively become normal at fields significantly below
      H<sub>c2</sub>. When they do, the lower-diffusivity S layers
      determine d H<sub>c2</sub>/dT, and the H<sub>c2</sub>(T)
      curve turns up. A detailed analysis of this situation has
      been worked out by Takahashi and Tachiki, who predict a
      first-order phase transition when the vortices fit into the N
      layer.[<a href="node66.html#takahashi86c">236</a>] This
      transition may already have been observed experimentally on
      Nb/Ta multilayers.[<a href=
      "node66.html#broussard87b">28</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#kanoda86">126</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The application of the idea of the decoupling of high- and
      low- H<sub>c2</sub> components to anisotropic gap/FS or
      multiband models is less obvious, but similar. The
      explanation has been given by Entel and Peter: ``For T -&gt;
      T<sub>c</sub> and H<sub>c2</sub>(T) -&gt; 0 one should look
      upon the condensation phenomenon as considering all electrons
      in a small energy shell around the Fermi level even if local
      regions on the Fermi surface contribute with a different
      weight to T<sub>c</sub>. But for T &lt;&lt; T<sub>c</sub>,
      the external field tends to suppress superconductivity in
      those regions of the Fermi surface where the electrons are
      more weakly coupled... the H<sub>c2</sub>(0) enhancement is
      merely determined by the strength of the off-diagonal
      electron-phonon coupling constants...''[<a href=
      "node66.html#entel76">80</a>] This interpretation is written
      in general enough language that it can also be seen as
      applying to a single anisotropic band. The similarity between
      the decoupling between bands in a multiband superconductor
      and layers in an artificially structured superlattice is
      evident in comparing this description and that of Takahashi
      and Tachiki.[<a href="node66.html#takahashi86c">236</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      A unified theoretical picture for the critical fields of
      layered materials would be a great achievement. Such a
      unification appears inevitable as layer thicknesses in
      artificially structured materials get smaller and smaller,
      approaching the scale where Fermi surface anisotropy and
      multiband effects begin to take over. In fact, the possible
      observation of Fermi surface anisotropy effects in
      artificially structured superlattices has already been
      reported.[<a href="node66.html#broussard88">29</a>]
      Undoubtedly new experiments will keep theorists busy for many
      years to come as they attempt to catch up with the
      experimental discoveries made possible by advances in
      fabrication.[<a href="node66.html#ruggiero85">209</a>] It
      seems likely that the smaller layer thicknesses in artificial
      structures get, the more they will look like transition metal
      dichalcogenides and GIC's in their qualitative critical field
      behavior.

      In this Chapter there has been mention several times of the
      different critical fields of the gold low- T<sub>c</sub> (
      T<sub>c</sub> 0.8K) and pink higher- T<sub>c</sub> (
      T<sub>c</sub> 1.5 K) C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples. Yet the
      intrinsic cause of the differences between these types of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg has not been discussed. The possible origin
      of these differences and the insight that hydrogenation
      experiments can give into this problem are the topic of the
      next Chapter.
