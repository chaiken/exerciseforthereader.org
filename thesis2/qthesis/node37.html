    <p>
      One often hears the statement that large spin-orbit
      scattering increases H<sub>c2</sub>(T) in a high-field
      superconductor. Since the spin-orbit interaction increases
      rapidly as a function of the atomic number[<a href=
      "node66.html#merzbacher70">170</a>] Z, and since Hg is a
      high-Z element, it is logical to ask whether spin-orbit
      scattering could enhance H<sub>c2</sub> in C<sub>4</sub>KHg.
      The answer is no, since it turns out that the spin-orbit
      ``enhancement'' only affects materials whose critical fields
      have already been depressed by Pauli limiting effects.[<a
      href="node66.html#werthamer66">262</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#orlando79">186</a>] ``Pauli limiting'' refers to
      the upper bound on H<sub>c2</sub>(T) from spin-susceptibility
      (Pauli paramagnetism) effects.[<a href=
      "node66.html#clogston62">45</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#chandrasekhar62">38</a>] Superconductors close
      to their Pauli limit have critical fields which are depressed
      from the Maki-deGennes temperature dependence. Paramagnetic
      limiting also affects the angular dependence of the critical
      field.[<a href="node66.html#aoi73">9</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#decroux82">53</a>] High rates of spin-orbit
      scattering can increase the susceptibility of the
      superconducting state to that of the normal state, and thus
      eliminate Pauli-limiting effects. Thus spin-orbit scattering
      and Pauli limiting effectively cancel one another out, and
      the final result of both effects is the same Maki-deGennes
      curve already discussed in Section <a href=
      "node34.html#hvstdata"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      .[<a href="node66.html#orlando79">186</a>] Since the two
      mechanisms cancel, and since spin-orbit scattering has no
      major impact for a superconductivity far from the
      paramagnetic limit, spin-orbit scattering cannot give a
      reduced field h<sup>*</sup>(0) <b>&gt;</b> 0.7, and cannot
      explain the enhanced linearity of H<sub>c2</sub>(T) observed
      in GIC's.
    </p>
    <p>
      While on the subject of electron spin, it is worth mentioning
      that GIC's appear to be far from the paramagnetic limit, as
      would be expected for low-critical field materials. The
      reason is that orbital pair-breaking effects are strong
      enough in GIC superconductors that they are far from the
      spin-susceptibility ceiling on H<sub>c2</sub>. The small
      values of the Maki <i>alpha</i> parameter[<a href=
      "node66.html#maki64">159</a>] for GIC's clearly demonstrate
      the validity of this statement, since spin contributions to
      the energy of a superconductor become important when
      <i>alpha</i> &gt;= 1. WHH[<a href=
      "node66.html#werthamer66">262</a>] provided two ways of
      calculating <i>alpha</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="alphadef" name="alphadef">&nbsp;</a><img align=
      "bottom" alt="" src="img94.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Here <i>Gamma</i> is the linear specific heat coefficient,
      and <i>rho</i><sub>n</sub> is the normal-state dc
      resistivity. In Eqn. <a href="node37.html#alphadef"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>, m is the bare electron
      mass, not the effective mass, since it comes from
      e<i>hbar</i>/2 <i>mu</i><sub>B</sub>c.[<a href=
      "node66.html#decroux82">53</a>] For C<sub>4</sub>KHg, the
      best method is to use <i>rho</i><sub>a</sub> to calculate
      <i>alpha</i> for <i>vec</i>H || ^c, and
      <i>sqrt</i><i>rho</i><sub>a</sub> <i>rho</i><sub>c</sub> to
      calculate <i>alpha</i> for <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c. The parameters
      used were <i>rho</i><sub>c</sub> = 0.2 milliohm-cm at 4.2
      K,[<a href="node66.html#fischer83">85</a>] and <i>Gamma</i> =
      0.95 millijoules / (mol K<sup>2</sup>)[<a href=
      "node66.html#alexander81">8</a>]. <i>rho</i><sub>a</sub> at
      4.2 K for C<sub>4</sub>KHg (which has not been reported) was
      estimated by assuming a resistivity anisotropy of 280, the
      same as the measured resistivity anisotropy at 100 K, the
      lowest temperature at which published <i>rho</i><sub>a</sub>
      data exist.[<a href="node66.html#elmakrini80">70</a>] Values
      of <i>alpha</i> obtained from both halves of Eqn. <a href=
      "node37.html#alphadef"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      are given in Table <a href="node37.html#alphatable"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>, which demonstrates that
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg is two to three orders of magnitude away
      from Pauli-limiting regime. With like assumptions, similar
      calculations for other GIC's give <i>alpha</i>'s of the same
      order of magnitude. Therefore spin-orbit scattering has no
      impact on the critical fields of C<sub>4</sub>KHg.

       <strong>Table:</strong> Comparison for C<sub>4</sub>KHg of
      two different methods for determination of Maki's

      is that of the applied magnetic field. In parentheses it is

      "13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> that ``It is a test of
      the applicability of our model for the superconductor that
      these two determinations of <i>alpha</i> should agree.''[<a
      href="node66.html#werthamer66">262</a>] Considering the
      crudeness of the assumptions made in the estimation of
      <i>rho</i>, the agreement in Table <a href=
      "node37.html#alphatable"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      between the two determinations of <i>alpha</i> is quite good.
      This is an indication that even though superconductivity in
      GIC's has some anomalous aspects, it still is explained by
      the same basic electron-phonon coupling mechanism that
      applies to isotropic superconductors. Therefore, in our
      search for models to explain the enhanced critical fields of
      GIC's, models with truly exotic coupling schemes (
      <em>e.g.,</em> plasmons and excitons) can safely be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another factor that contributes to critical field enhancement
      in isotropic superconductors besides spin-orbit scattering is
      strong-coupling effects. ``Strong-coupling'' refers to the
      case of a large electron-phonon interaction. The strength of
      electron-phonon coupling is measured by the size of the
      dimensionless parameter <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub>, the same
      electron-phonon parameter that appears in the dressed
      density-of-states found from specific-heat measurements.[<a
      href="node66.html#ashcroft76">10</a>] Note that
      <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub> is not related to the
      magnetic-field penetration depth <i>Lambda</i> (see Section
      <a href="node28.html#angdata"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> for a discussion of the penetration depth). McMillan[<a
      href="node66.html#mcmillan68">165</a>] calculated
      T<sub>c</sub> in terms of <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub> and
      <i>mu</i> <sup>*</sup>, the Coulomb pseudopotential of Morel
      and Anderson[<a href="node66.html#morel62">174</a>]. He
      found:<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <img align="bottom" alt="" src="img96.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      where <i>theta</i><sub>D</sub> is the Debye temperature.
      Using a typical number of <i>mu</i><sup>*</sup> = 0.1,[<a
      href="node66.html#mcmillan68">165</a>], one can solve for
      <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub>:

      "bottom" alt="" src="img97.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The results of this calculation for the superconducting GIC's
      whose Debye temperature has been measured are collected in
      Table <a href="node37.html#lambdatable"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>.
      <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub> in GIC superconductors appears to
      be 0.4, about the same as in prototypical weak-coupling
      superconductors like aluminum and zinc.[<a href=
      "node66.html#mcmillan68">165</a>] This is in keeping with
      one's expectations for a material with a rather low
      T<sub>c</sub> of about 1-2 K.

      parameter, for GIC superconductors. T<sub>c</sub> = 0.73 K[<a
      href="node66.html#iye82">120</a>] is used for
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg since no transition was observed down to 0.8
      K during the specific-heat measurement.[<a href=
      "node66.html#alexander81">8</a>] Values of
      <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub> for the KH-GIC's are gathered in
      Table <a href="node44.html#khcvtable"><img width="13" height=

    </p>
    <p>
      In amorphous superconductors, strong-coupling effects can
      cause extended linearity at low temperatures.[<a href=
      "node66.html#bergmann74">19</a>] However, the values of
      <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub> quoted above eliminate the
      possibility that GIC superconductors are subject to any
      critical field field enhancement from strong-coupling
      effects, since these effects are important only for
      <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub> &gt;= 1. Furthermore, since the
      strong-coupling enhancement is larger near T<sub>c</sub> than
      at low t,[<a href="node66.html#decroux82">53</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#dalrymple83">50</a>] strong-coupling effects
      tend to actually <em>decrease</em> h<sup>*</sup>(0), the
      reduced field at zero temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently some theories of ultra-strong coupling
      superconductivity have been published, inspired by the advent
      of high-temperature superconductivity.[<a href=
      "node66.html#bulaevskii87">31</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#marsiglio87">162</a>] Some of these models find
      positive curvature of H<sub>c2</sub>(t). Bulaevskii and
      Dolgov[<a href="node66.html#bulaevskii87">31</a>] find that
      h<sup>*</sup>(0) = 0.45<i>sqrt</i><i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub>
      for <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub> &gt;&gt; 1. Marsiglio and
      Carbotte find h<sup>*</sup>(0) about 1.6, but only when
      T<sub>c</sub> <i>theta</i><sub>D</sub>.[<a href=
      "node66.html#marsiglio87">162</a>] These models are clearly
      not applicable to superconductivity in known GIC's.
    </p>
    <p>
      For GIC's, a more relevant consideration than strong-coupling
      is inhomogeneity. From both structural[<a href=
      "node66.html#kamitakahara84">123</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#K167">246</a>] and superconducting[<a href=
      "node66.html#Z234">206</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#delong83">55</a>] studies, there is abundant
      evidence for the coexistence of multiple phases in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg. This evidence is discussed in detail in
      Chapter <a href="node40.html#hydrog"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. As far as critical
      field experiments go, this multiphase behavior is important
      because of the possibility that inhomogeneity is the cause of
      the enhanced linearity of the critical fields of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg. Carter and coauthors[<a href=
      "node66.html#carter81">34</a>] developed a model for the case
      of multiphase materials which contain both an equilibrium and
      higher free-energy phase. The model treats the inhomogeneity
      by allowing the superconductor to have a distribution of
      diffusivities described by a function P(D). Then, instead of
      the Maki-deGennes equation (Eqn. <a href=
      "node34.html#makidegennes"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> )
      for the critical fields of dirty superconductors, one uses:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="carter" name="carter">&nbsp;</a><img align="bottom"
      alt="" src="img99.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      where all the symbols are the same as before, and <i>psi</i>
      is the digamma function. Carter <em>et al.</em> found that by
      widening the distribution P(D) from a <i>Delta</i>-function
      (implied by the choice of a single D value) to a broad hump
      that they could produce both positive curvature and
      h<sup>*</sup>(0) 0.85. By skewing the distribution P(D) to
      low D, they could even get h<sup>*</sup>(0) <b>&gt;</b>
      0.9.[<a href="node66.html#carter81">34</a>] The results of
      their calculations are shown in Fig. <a href=
      "node37.html#inhomo"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      where h<sup>*</sup> (called h in the axis label) is plotted
      versus t as a function of the normalized diffusivity
      distribution function, Q(y). Q(y) == D <sub>ave</sub> P(D),
      where D<sub>ave</sub> is the mean diffusivity, and y == D/
      D<sub>ave</sub>.

       <strong>Figure:</strong> Extended critical field linearity
      due to small-scale sample inhomogeneity. From a calculation
      by Carter and colleagues.[<a href=
      "node66.html#carter81">34</a>] The plots are of reduced field
      versus reduced temperature for several different normalized
      diffusivity distribution functions Q(y). Q(y) ==
      D<sub>ave</sub>P(D), where P(D) is the distribution function
      for diffusivity, D<sub>ave</sub> is the average diffusivity,
      and y == D/D <sub>ave</sub>. In the lower plot, a P(D) skewed
      to lower diffusivities produces an even greater critical
      field enhancement at low temperatures. The index n refers to
      the power of the linear factor used to skew the symmetric
      distribution.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The physical cause of the inhomogeneity-related enhancement
      has to do with the temperature dependence of <i>xi</i>, which
      is the approximate radius of a normal vortex in a
      superconductor.[<a href="node66.html#tinkham80">252</a>] At T
      T<sub>c</sub>, <i>xi</i> is large, so that vortices must
      extend over both high-D and low-D regions in the material. At
      low t, where <i>xi</i> has grown considerably smaller, the
      material can save some condensation energy by preferentially
      packing the vortices into the low-D regions with higher
      critical fields. As a result, when <i>xi</i>(T) becomes on
      the order of the domain size, H<sub>c2</sub> will turn
      upward.[<a href="node66.html#carter81">34</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Does this model offer an explanation of positive curvature
      and enhanced linearity in the critical fields of GIC's?
      Clearly the inhomogeneity interpretation has some appealing
      features for C<sub>4</sub>KHg, but it also has some problems.
      One is that among the GIC superconductors, multiphase
      behavior has been observed only in C<sub>4</sub>KHg. As is
      discussed in Chapter <a href="node40.html#hydrog"><img width=
      "13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>, C<sub>4</sub>KHg is
      remarkable among the superconducting GIC's for the wide range
      of T<sub>c</sub>'s it exhibits (from 0.7 to 1.6 K), and
      because it undergoes what is apparently an ordering
      transition under the influence of small perturbations
      (hydrogenation[<a href="node66.html#Z234">206</a>] and small
      hydrostatic pressure[<a href="node66.html#delong83">55</a>]).
      These features are not observed for other GIC's, which have
      well-defined transition temperatures and show no unusual
      behavior under pressure.[<a href=
      "node66.html#iye83">116</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#delong83">55</a>] It does not seem to make sense
      to attribute the anomalies in C<sub>4</sub>KHg to a different
      cause than the deviations seen in other GIC's, especially
      considering that the other GIC's show larger anomalies (see
      Fig. <a href="node34.html#rbhct"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> ).
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if one were willing to assume separate causes for the
      enhanced critical fields of the various GIC's, it is not
      clear that the model of Carter and colleagues would be
      applicable. The problem is that their model makes the
      (reasonable) assumption that microscopically inhomogeneous
      superconductors will be in the dirty limit, where the
      Maki-deGennes equation is applicable. However,
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg appears to be fairly ``clean,'' at least for
      in-plane transport. The standard way to quantify cleanliness
      in a superconductor is to calculate the parameter
      <i>Lambda</i><sub>tr</sub> == 0.882 <i>xi</i><sub>0</sub> /
      <i>l</i>.[<a href="node66.html#helfand66">108</a>] Here
      <i>xi</i><sub>0</sub> == 0.18 <i>hbar</i> v<sub>F</sub>/
      k<sub>B</sub> T<sub>c</sub> is the Pippard coherence length,
      and <i>l</i> is the mean-free path. For C<sub>4</sub>KHg,
      <i>xi</i><sub>0</sub> is roughly 9000 &Aring;, and
      <i>l</i><sub>a</sub>, the in-plane mean-free path, is about
      9100 &Aring;. (These numbers were obtained from
      Shubnikov-deHaas data[<a href="node66.html#W179">245</a>]
      using standard rigid-band analysis, as demonstrated in
      Appendix <a href="node65.html#lambda_tr"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .) Since
      <i>l</i><sub>a</sub> <i>xi</i><sub>0</sub>, the dimensionless
      parameter <i>Lambda</i><sub>tr</sub> == 0.88
      <i>xi</i><sub>0</sub>/<i>l</i> 0.86 for in-plane transport.
      <i>Lambda</i><sub>tr</sub> <b>&lt;</b> 1 is indicative of
      fairly clean behavior,[<a href=
      "node66.html#helfand66">108</a>] so this is an indication
      that inhomogeneities are not likely to be the cause of
      enhanced linearity, at least for <i>vec</i>H || ^c. However,
      this calculation does not rule out a diffusivity-variation
      influence on <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c. Transport is expected to be
      much dirtier along ^c, where the resistivity is about 300
      times higher than in-plane.[<a href=
      "node66.html#fischer83">85</a>] <i>Lambda</i><sub>tr</sub> is
      estimated very roughly to be about 50 for c-axis transport by
      assuming a spherical band. (No well-bounded number is
      available since the Shubnikov-deHaas data give no information
      about the intercalant bands.[<a href=
      "node66.html#W179">245</a>] c-axis transport in GIC's is
      discussed in Section <a href="node58.html#csbidisc"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, use of the inhomogeneity model for enhanced
      H<sub>c2</sub> can be justified for C<sub>4</sub>KHg for
      <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c, but it is hard to justify for <i>vec</i>H
      || ^c, or for other superconducting GIC's. Therefore the most
      sensible conclusion is that, while the factors discussed by
      Carter <em>et al.</em> may play a role in C<sub>4</sub>KHg,
      they probably do not have a dominant effect on
      H<sub>c2</sub>(T).

    <p>
      Finally, to round out the discussion of critical field
      enhancement in isotropic superconductors, mention should be
      made of the anomalous H<sub>c2</sub>(T) behavior found in
      heavy-fermion superconductors.[<a href=
      "node66.html#delong87">57</a>] These unusual materials
      exhibit both positive curvature and large values of
      h<sup>*</sup>(0). Any explanation of these phenomena must
      remain tentative since the basic physics of these compounds
      is still controversial,[<a href="node66.html#lee86">156</a>]
      but recently an interesting model has been proposed by DeLong
      <em>et al.</em>[<a href="node66.html#delong87">57</a>] The
      explanation is based on the observation that
      dH<sub>c2</sub>/dT <i>propto</i> <i>rho</i> in the usual WHH
      model, as shown in Eqn. <a href="node37.html#alphadef"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> . If the normal-state
      resistance <i>rho</i> is assumed independent of field up to
      H<sub>c2</sub>, then one gets the usual WHH result
      h<sup>*</sup>(0) 0.7. However, if there is a very strong
      magnetoresistance (the manifestation of a field-dependent
      pairing interaction), then the slope formula shows that
      h<sup>*</sup>(0) can exceed 0.7 by a factor of <i>Delta</i>
      <i>rho</i>(H<sub>c2</sub>) / <i>rho</i>.[<a href=
      "node66.html#delong87">57</a>] Here <i>Delta</i>
      <i>rho</i>(H<sub>c2</sub>) / <i>rho</i> is the
      magnetoresistance at the field H<sub>c2</sub>; the normal
      state resistivity at zero-field is extrapolated from above
      T<sub>c</sub>. This formalism may have wide applicability to
      superconductors with large or anomalous magnetoresistance;
      however, it appears unlikely to help much in the case of
      GIC's, since the critical fields are small enough that the
      magnitude of <i>Delta</i>
      <i>rho</i>(H<sub>c2</sub>)/<i>rho</i> is anticipated to be 0.
      The magnetoresistance of the KHg-GIC's was observed by Timp
      and coworkers, who reported nothing extraordinary.[<a href=
      "node66.html#W179">245</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Four causes of critical field enhancement in isotropic
      superconductors have been discussed: spin-orbit scattering,
      strong-coupling effects, inhomogeneities, and
      magnetoresistance. Of these, only the
      multiphase-superconductor model of Carter <em>et al.</em> is
      thought to be relevant to GIC superconductors. Inhomogeneity
      effects could play a role for <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c, but except
      for C<sub>4</sub>KHg, there is no hard evidence for
      multiphase behavior in other superconducting GIC's except for
      C<sub>4</sub>KH<sub>x</sub>.[<a href=
      "node66.html#Z260">79</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#suzuki85c">232</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The extremely anisotropic nature of superconductivity in
      GIC's (1/<i>epsilon</i> as high as 47[<a href=
      "node66.html#iye83">116</a>]) provides motivation to consider
      models of positive curvature and enhanced linearity which
      treat orientation-dependent effects as central. Some of these
      models are considered in the next section.
