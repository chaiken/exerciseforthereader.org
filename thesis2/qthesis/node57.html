      Similar Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations were seen in all pure
      <i>alpha</i>-phase samples studied. Only very weak
      oscillations were seen in mixed-phase <i>alpha</i> +
      <i>beta</i> samples, probably due to a smaller value of
      (<i>Omega</i><sub>c</sub> <i>tau</i>) caused by in-plane
      disorder. A representative Fourier transform calculated from
      the <i>alpha</i>-phase SdH data is shown in Figure <a href=
      "node57.html#sdhcalc"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      a). This scan shows the frequency which was seen
      consistently, at (1120 &plusmn; 110) T.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to verify the authenticity of the highest frequency,
      the one used in the subsequent data analysis, various small
      portions of the data were Fourier transformed separately, to
      see if the 1120 T requency was an artifact of the analysis.
      However, it was found that this frequency appeared strongly
      no matter what field range of data was used for the Fourier
      transform. In addition, in order to get some intuition as to
      what the 1120 T frequency should look like experimentally, a
      calculated version of the trace was compared to the data
      using the fit parameters. The calculation used the accepted
      form of the temperature and field dependence of the amplitude
      of SdH oscillations:[<a href="node66.html#Z260">79</a>]<br />

    <p>
      where A is the amplitude of the oscillations, T<sub>D</sub>
      is the Dingle temperature, and <i>Omega</i><sub>c</sub> is
      the cyclotron frequency, through which A is dependent on the
      magnetic field. The Dingle temperature characterizes the
      degree of disorder in a solid through:[<a href=
      "node66.html#Z260">79</a>]<br />

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      where <i>tau</i><sub>col</sub> is the transport collision
      time. An unusually large value of the Dingle temperature of
      about 5 K had to be used to produce the calculated trace
      shown in Figure <a href="node57.html#sdhcalc"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>b). The collision time in
      the C<sub>4</sub>CsBi<sub>0.6</sub> samples is probably short
      due to the scattering from the metal inclusions discussed
      previously in Section <a href="node52.html#csbitc"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. Confidence in the
      validity of the frequencies obtained from the Fourier
      transforms is increased because of the good qualitative
      agreement between the calculated curve and the data shown in
      Figure <a href="node57.html#sdhcalc"><img width="13" height=

      Once the maximum SdH frequency of 1120 T has been determined,
      one can use the dilute-limit model as a first approach to
      understanding the data. This model assumes that the primary
      effect of intercalation is to increase the size of the
      graphitic <i>pi</i>-derived ellipsoids at the K point of the
      Brillouin zone, leaving the shape of the ellipsoids
      unmodified. The validity of this assumption for stage I GIC's
      could be criticized because of the high intercalant densities
      involved. However, the excellent agreement obtained by Timp
      <em>et al.</em>[<a href="node66.html#W179">245</a>] with
      other more direct measurements of Fermi energies and charge
      transfers gives some justification for the model's use.
      [These values are collected in Table <a href=
      "node57.html#electronicparams"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> below.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Proceeding then cautiously in the spirit of the
      Dresselhaus-Leung (DL) model[<a href=
      "node66.html#F60">65</a>], one can relate the compounds'
      Fermi energy to its maximal FS cross-section, <i>cal</i>
      A<sub>max</sub><sup>e</sup>, and thus to the largest observed
      SdH frequency, <i>nu</i><sub>max</sub>. The expressions that
      describe this relationship, derived by DL, are:<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="sdhE_F" name="sdhE_F">&nbsp;</a><img align="bottom"
      alt="" src="img130.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the E's are parameters of the DL model, the
      <i>Gamma</i>'s are graphite band parameters, and
      a<sub>0</sub> is the graphite in-plane lattice constant.
      Equation <a href="node57.html#sdhE_F"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> can be used to solve for
      E<sub>F</sub>, giving a value of 0.93 eV. This value seems
      low for a stage 1 donor compound, as Table <a href=
      "node57.html#electronicparams"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> shows. Yet, within the accuracy of the approximations
      made in the use of Equation <a href="node57.html#sdhE_F"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> , the agreement of this
      value with the 1.3 eV obtained by Yang and colleagues from
      reflectivity measurements[<a href=
      "node66.html#yang88">270</a>] is acceptable. The 1.3 eV
      number is itself based on the ``mirror bands'' approximation,
      whose quantitative correctness for donor compounds is not
      well-established.
    </p>
    <p>
      With knowledge of the in-plane structure, one can also
      C<sub>4</sub>CsBi<sub>0.6</sub> also estimate the charge
      transfer per carbon atom, f<sub>C</sub>. f<sub>C</sub> is
      approximately equal to the number of electrons per carbon
      atom in a GIC since the carrier density in pristine graphite
      is so low.[<a href="node66.html#I94">67</a>] The number of
      electrons per carbon atom is the ratio of the number of
      electrons per unit cell to the number of carbon atoms per
      unit cell. The number of electrons per unit cell is the ratio
      of the FS volume to the Brillouin zone (BZ) volume:<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      e<sup>-</sup> / C-atom = (e<sup>-</sup> /unit cell) /
      (C-atoms / unit cell)<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The volume of a piece of <i>pi</i>-electron FS can be
      estimated in the spirit of the DL model as the size of a
      cylinder with a circular cross-section of area <i>cal</i>
      A<sub>max</sub><sup>e</sup> and height 2<i>pi</i> /
      I<sub>c</sub>:<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <img align="bottom" alt="" src="img131.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The total volume of the FS is then the number of cylinders
      per BZ (six) times the volume per cylinder. Note that the
      number of carbon atoms per unit cell and the volume of the BZ
      depend on the in-plane structure of the intercalant. At the
      time that Ref. [<a href="node66.html#E291">36</a>] was
      published, the authors did not know of any work on the
      in-plane structural work on the CsBi-GIC's, and so calculated
      f<sub>C</sub> using the (2X2)R0&deg;, since this structure is
      common in donor GIC's.[<a href="node66.html#I94">67</a>] A
      new number for f<sub>C</sub> has been calculated now that a
      specific in-plane structure has been observed in these
      materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bendriss-Rerhrhaye in her thesis proposes a (3<i>root</i>13 X
      8)R(15&deg;,0&deg;) rhombic unit cell for
      C<sub>4</sub>CsBi<sub>0.6</sub>.[<a href=
      "node66.html#bendriss86">17</a>] This proposed structure is
      shown in Figure <a href="node57.html#csbistruct"><img width=
      "13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. The BZ associated with
      such a unit cell will obviously be much smaller than the
      graphitic one, but this is partially compensated for by the
      large number of carbon atoms (192) in the unit cell. Using
      the 1120 T SdH frequency to calculate <i>cal</i>
      A<sub>max</sub><sup>e</sup> gives an f<sub>C</sub> of -0.026
      electrons per carbon atom. This value is about two-thirds of
      that obtained from reflectivity measurements by Yang <em>et
      al.</em>[<a href="node66.html#yang88">270</a>], just as the
      E<sub>F</sub> obtained from SdH is about two-thirds of that
      from reflectivity. [See Table <a href=
      "node57.html#electronicparams"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> ] The f<sub>C</sub> number of Yang and colleagues is
      obtained directly from their Fermi energy using the
      Blinowski-Rigaux (BR) tight-binding model.[<a href=
      "node66.html#blinowski80">27</a>] Therefore it is dependent
      on both the mirror-bands approximation (used to get
      E<sub>F</sub>) and the assumptions of the BR model, which,
      like the DL model, uses graphitic parameters to describe the
      <i>pi</i> bands of the intercalation compound. Taking all
      approximations into account, the E<sub>F</sub> and
      f<sub>C</sub> numbers of the two references should be about
      equally reliable. The lower value of the Fermi energy
      calculated from the SdH data could be due to a high-frequency
      oscillation that was not observed. A high-frequency
      oscillation appears to have been missed in the compound
      C<sub>4</sub>KH<sub>x</sub>.[<a href=
      "node66.html#doll87">62</a>] A frequency of about 1700 T
      would be needed for perfect agreement of the CsBi SdH data
      with the data of Yang.
