    <p>
      The determination of the stoichiometry of graphite
      intercalation compounds is an important aspect of their
      characterization. The reason is that intercalation is a slow
      chemical process, particularly for higher-stage and ternary
      compounds. Even if an intercalation reaction proceeds for
      several weeks at an elevated temperature, the final product
      (a GIC) may not have reached its equilibrium state. The
      hypothetical metastable final state of the GIC might be a
      mixed-stage compound, which wouldn't be so bad, since
      mixed-stage samples are easily detectable with (00<i>l</i>)
      x-rays. Mixed-stage samples can be separated out from the
      well-staged ones and discarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A much more insidious situation arises if the compound is
      well-staged but is off the equilibrium stoichiometry. For one
      thing, there is the question of what the equilibrium
      stoichiometry is, a longstanding problem with acceptor
      GIC's.[<a href="node66.html#C159">74</a>] In principle,
      stoichiometries can be determined from the x-ray diffraction
      pattern, as was done with the neutron scattering data.
      However, to have real confidence in the stoichiometries found
      from fits to (00<i>l</i>) integrated intensities, one needs
      either a large number of peaks, or extensive knowledge of the
      structure of the material in question. Especially in the case
      of multiphase systems like the KHg- and CsBi-GIC's, an
      independent check of the stoichiometries determined from
      diffraction data is highly desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      One type of non-destructive chemical analysis that has been
      used with great success on GIC's is Rutherford backscattering
      spectrometry (RBS). RBS provides information on composition
      only in about the top one micron of a specimen,[<a href=
      "node66.html#S175">212</a>] but it has the advantage of doing
      so in a structure-independent way. Also, since RBS gives
      depth resolution as well as species identification, any alloy
      adsorbed on the surface can readily be differentiated from
      the bulk. RBS measurements were performed on KHg-GIC's by
      Salamanca-Riba <em>et al.</em>, who found stoichiometries of
      C<sub>3.0 &plusmn; 1.5</sub>KHg<sub>0.77 &plusmn; 0.08</sub>
      for stage 1, C<sub>7 &plusmn; 1.4</sub>KHg<sub>0.72 &plusmn;
      0.07</sub> for stage 2, and C<sub>13 &plusmn;
      1.3</sub>KHg<sub>0.62 &plusmn; 0.06</sub> for stage 3. The
      low ratio of carbon atoms to potassium atoms found in this
      study is somewhat surprising, but the margin of error is so
      large that no definite conclusions can be drawn. However, the
      tentative C/K ratio of 3.0 supports the existence of the (
      <i>sqrt</i>3 &times; <i>sqrt</i>3)R30&deg; phase, for which
      3.0 is the stoichiometric C/K ratio. For the (2 &times;
      2)R0&deg; and (<i>sqrt</i>3 &times; 2)R(30&deg;, 0&deg;)
      phases, a ratio of four is anticipated. Once again, the (
      <i>sqrt</i>3 &times; <i>sqrt</i>3)R30&deg; phase seems to be
      turning up in a surface-sensitive experiment; this phase had
      previously been seen only in Raman scattering and TEM
      studies.[<a href="node66.html#N128">247</a>] Because of the
      nature of the measurements in which the ( <i>sqrt</i>3
      &times; <i>sqrt</i>3)R30&deg; phase has been seen, one might
      wonder if its appearance is related to deintercalation due to
      sample heating.
    </p>
    <p>
      The better-bracketed parameter found by RBS is the Hg/K
      ratio, which appears to be about 0.7. The stoichiometries
      found for the KHg-GIC's in several different experiments are
      summarized in Table <a href="node19.html#stoichtab"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. As is evident from the
      Table, a Hg/K ratio of 0.7 is less than any of the values
      established from the x-ray or neutron diffraction
      experiments. This Hg/K ratio was only determined on one GIC
      of each stage,[<a href="node66.html#S175">212</a>] so its
      magnitude may be affected by sample dependence. However, the
      agreement for all three samples of different stage is
      impressive. In fact, one might wonder if the constant Hg/K
      ratio with such a widely varying C/K ratio is not a sign that
      another property of the surface rather than the bulk is being
      measured. This possibility was put forward by the authors of
      Ref. [<a href="node66.html#S175">212</a>], who noted that
      surface depletion of mercury from C<sub>4</sub>KHg under
      heating had been observed using x-rays.[<a href=
      "node66.html#A157">82</a>] The explanation of the tendency
      toward surface depletion of mercury is that since it
      intercalates after the potassium does,[<a href=
      "node66.html#A157">82</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#elmakrini80">70</a>] it must also deintercalate
      first. This idea is believable also because mercury has a
      high vapor pressure and is rather chemically inert, with the
      result that its gradual surface depletion is a common
      phenomenon in many types of materials. For example, surface
      mercury depletion is a problem in HgCdTe wafers used in
      infrared detectors.[<a href="node66.html#hgcdte83">143</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      RBS measurements have also been performed on the CsBi-GIC's
      in collaboration with Dr. J. Steinbeck.[<a href=
      "node66.html#E291">36</a>] The experimental conditions were
      similar to those of Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#S175">212</a>], except that the GIC's were
      cleaved before measurement to remove the alloy adhered on the
      surface. For an <i>alpha</i>-phase stage 1 CsBi-GIC sample,
      the result of this experiment was a stoichiometry C<sub>(2.5
      &plusmn; 0.65)</sub>CsBi<sub>0.59 &plusmn; 0.03</sub>, in
      excellent agreement with the previously reported Bi/Cs ratio
      of C<sub>4</sub>CsBi<sub>0.55</sub>.[<a href=
      "node66.html#lagrange87">145</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#yang87">271</a>] The accord between the Cs/Bi
      ratio found here and that determined by x-rays[<a href=
      "node66.html#lagrange87">145</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#yang87">271</a>] increases one's confidence in
      the Hg/K ratio found from RBS, although there is not a
      problem with volatility in the CsBi-GIC's the way that there
      is in mercury-containing materials. The problem in
      synthesizing the CsBi-GIC's is signalled by the unexpectedly
      low C/Cs ratio, which is an indication of the tendency to
      have macroscopic alloy inclusions in the samples, even when
      the surfaces are cleaned of any adhered metal. These
      inclusions are discussed further in Section <a href=
      "node52.html#csbitc"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>.

    <p>
      Another non-destructive measurement that can be performed on
      air-stable samples is weight uptake. If the mass of the host
      graphite is determined before intercalation, and the
      stoichiometric ratio of the two intercalant metals is known
      from another measurement, such as RBS, then after
      intercalation the extent to which the reaction was completed
      can be estimated. For C<sub>4</sub>CsBi<sub>0.55</sub>, a
      simple calculation shows that the expected weight uptake is
      5.2 times the graphite mass. Measured weight uptakes were
      usually on the order of 5.5 to 5.6 times the graphite mass,
      even after careful cleaning of the surface. This excess
      weight is another indication of the inclusions indicated by
      the RBS and TEM studies. (TEM observations of the inclusions
      are discussed in Section <a href="node52.html#csbitc"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      While it would be highly desirable to perform weight-uptake
      measurements on the KHg-GIC's, this has not been done because
      of the compounds' high reactivity in air. An ideal set-up
      would be to have a microbalance inside a dry-box for routine
      weight-uptake measurements after intercalation, a practice
      carried out at the University of Kentucky.[<a href=
      "node66.html#doll86">63</a>] Weight uptake data on
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg would be particularly interesting to compare
      to measurements of the areal fraction of superconductivity
      from inductive studies of the zero-field transition. (See
      Section <a href="node24.html#critfexp"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> for an explanation of
      how the areal fraction of superconductivity is determined.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The next-best-thing to weight uptake and RBS for the
      determination of stoichiometry is wet chemical analysis. Wet
      chemical analysis was performed on C<sub>4</sub>KHg GIC's by
      Dr. W. Correia of the Center for Materials Science Chemical
      Analysis Facility. The basic procedure is to dissolve the
      specimen in a solution and precipitate out the various
      constituents separately for weighing. The contribution of
      each of the elements in the sample can be determined this
      way. While these measurements can be fairly accurate, and
      have the advantage of giving information about the bulk of
      the specimen, they also have the distinct disadvantage of
      destroying the sample. Therefore, while wet chemical analysis
      is useful, it has been performed on only a few specimens. The
      results are included in Table <a href=
      "node19.html#stoichtab"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing conclusions from the data in the Table is difficult.
      There does not seem to be a strong connection between Hg
      content and T<sub>c</sub>, contrary to much speculation that
      Hg-deficient samples have lower transition temperatures.[<a
      href="node66.html#H242">207</a>] The lowest T<sub>c</sub>
      sample actually has the highest Hg/K ratio of 1.2. The
      observation that gold lower- T<sub>c</sub> specimens have
      more <i>beta</i> phase than higher- T<sub>c</sub> specimens
      is therefore consistent with the work of Yang <em>et
      al.</em>,[<a href="node66.html#yang84">272</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#yang88">270</a>] who found the <i>beta</i> phase
      of C<sub>4</sub>KHg has a higher Hg content (of 1.3). The
      T<sub>c</sub> = 1.3 K sample has a composition that agrees
      well with the RBS measurements, while the T<sub>c</sub> =
      1.54 K sample agrees in composition with the neutron
      scattering measurements. All the specimens appear to be close
      to the expected C/Hg ratio of 4. A systematic study of any
      possible relation between stoichiometry and superconductivity
      still needs to be performed on fully characterized samples.
      The available evidence does not make a strong case for the
      importance of variable stoichiometry since most of the
      samples have chemical formulae close to that originally
      reported by El Makrini.[<a href=
      "node66.html#elmakrini80">70</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the most important characterization that needs to
      be done on superconducting materials is the measurement of
      the zero-field superconducting transition temperature, called
      T<sub>c</sub> here. Zero-field T<sub>c</sub> experiments are
      discussed in the next section.
