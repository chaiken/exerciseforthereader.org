      The effect of hydrogen on superconductivity in C<sub>8</sub>K
      must be a balance of opposing tendencies since hydrogen can
      either raise or lower T<sub>c</sub>. From the discussion
      above concerning the transition metals, one might anticipate
      that the opposing factors might be the decrease in carrier
      density and increase in electron-phonon coupling that are
      generally associated with hydrogenation of metals.[<a href=
      "node66.html#switendick78">233</a>] The T<sub>c</sub>'s of
      hydrogenated K-GIC's are collected in Table <a href=
      "node44.html#khtctable"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .

       <strong>Table:</strong> Superconducting transition
      temperatures of the KH-GIC's and C<sub>8</sub>K. Two methods
      of preparation are possible: direct intercalation of KH
      powder into graphite,[<a href="node66.html#enoki88a">76</a>]
      and intercalation of K into graphite to form C<sub>8</sub>K,
      followed by hydrogen chemisorption.[<a href=
      "node66.html#enoki85">78</a>] Single-phase specimens are
      difficult to obtain because of slow hydrogen sorption
      kinetics.[<a href="node66.html#suzuki85b">231</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#enoki85">78</a>]<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation in the KH-GIC's is complicated by the presence
      of multiple phases, just as in the KHg-GIC's. In the
      KH-GIC's, both <i>alpha</i> ( I<sub>c</sub> = 8.43-8.53
      &Aring;) and <i>beta</i> ( I<sub>c</sub> = 9.13 &Aring;)
      phases can coexist in a given sample.[<a href=
      "node66.html#I217">213</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#suzuki85b">231</a>] The structure and
      stoichiometry of these phases is uncertain.[<a href=
      "node66.html#miyajima88">171</a>] To complicate matters
      further, staging disorder is also a common feature of the
      KH-GIC's, unlike the KHg-GIC's, which are nearly always
      single-stage. One reason for the staging disorder in the
      chemisorbed compounds is the complex behavior as a function
      of hydrogen stoichiometry. Starting with a C<sub>8</sub>K
      sample, hydrogen goes into interstitial sites in
      C<sub>8</sub>K up to x = 0.1. For x <b>&gt;</b> 0.1, the
      stage II compound, also denoted C<sub>8</sub>KH<sub>x</sub>,
      begins to form. Stage I and stage II coexist until x = 0.67,
      when the last stage I material transforms to stage II.[<a
      href="node66.html#lagrange74">153</a>] Other reasons for
      disorder are the large number of steps that go into the
      reaction and the fairly complicated final structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite all this complexity, Enoki <em>et al.</em> have done
      an admirable job of making sense out of the numbers in Table
      <a href="node44.html#khtctable"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> . Their interpretation, which is based on specific heat
      and conductivity measurements, is summarized by Figure <a
      href="node44.html#khC_v"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      below. The decline in <i>Gamma</i> with increasing x shows
      that H is lowering the carrier density and must have at least
      a partially ionic character. The lower density of states in
      the KH-GIC's as compared to the K-GIC's is also seen in
      Shubnikov-deHaas[<a href="node66.html#Z260">79</a>] and
      optical measurements.[<a href="node66.html#doll87">62</a>]
      The sequential increase and decrease in
      <i>theta</i><sub>D</sub> and T<sub>E</sub> shows that
      hydrogen first stiffens and then softens both the acoustic
      and optic modes in C<sub>8</sub>K.

      The data shown in Figure <a href="node44.html#khC_v"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> can be analyzed to
      produce the numbers listed in Table <a href=
      "node44.html#khcvtable"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      which is adapted from Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#enoki85">78</a>]. The conclusions one draws from
      examination of this table are similar to those from study of
      the transition metal hydrides, but with some important
      differences. As noted in Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#enoki85">78</a>], the main effect of hydrogen is
      that as a function of x the electron-phonon coupling
      parameter increases and the density of states at the Fermi
      level decreases. The T<sub>c</sub> enhancement with
      hydrogenation is therefore accounted for mostly by a larger
      <i>Lambda</i>. The increase in <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub>
      with x is overwhelmed at large x by the decrease in carrier
      density that is reflected by the fall in the DOS.

      None of the previous statements is at all surprising in light
      of the results of hydrogenation on the transition metals.
      What is a little bit hard to account for is the mechanism by
      which <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub> increases. According to
      Equation <a href="node43.html#lambdacalc"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>, the hydrogen-induced
      rise in <i>theta</i><sub>D</sub> and T<sub>E</sub> in the
      KH-GIC's should lower rather than raise
      <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub>. The source of the T<sub>c</sub>
      increase in the KH-GIC's may be the optic modes associated
      with the hydrogen atoms, just as in the hydrogenated
      transition metals.[<a href="node66.html#enoki88">77</a>] The
      very slight metallic character of H in KH-GIC's[<a href=
      "node66.html#miyajima88">171</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#enoki87">75</a>] could contribute to the
      enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling. Evidence for the
      hydrogen hole band near the Fermi level comes from electron
      spin resonance, thermopower, and conductivity
      measurements.[<a href="node66.html#miyajima88">171</a>,<a
      href="node66.html#enoki87">75</a>] The schematic density of
      states of C<sub>8</sub>K before and after hydrogenation is

      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. The reasonableness of
      the optic-mode explanation for the hydrogen-induced
      T<sub>c</sub> increase is hard to judge, but further
      experiments are underway.

      Superconductivity in the KH-GIC's is not completely
      understood, but there are several generalizations that can be
      made. Firstly, hydrogenation tends to decrease the density of
      states at the Fermi level by putting carriers into low-lying
      hydrogen bands. Secondly, hydrogenation strongly increases
      the electron-phonon coupling, although how exactly it does so
      is not clear. Whether the optic phonons associated with
      hydrogen are crucial for the KH-GIC's, as they are in the
      transition metals, is not yet certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the KH-GIC's, another group of materials with much in
      common with the KHg-GIC's is the transition metal
      dichalcogenides. The effect of hydrogenation on
      superconductivity in the TMDC's is discussed below.
