      The direct ancestor of the KLB papers, and one of the primary
      contributions to the AGL model, is the Josephson-coupling
      theory of Lawrence and Doniach[<a href=
      "node66.html#lawrence71">155</a>]. Lawrence and Doniach
      started with the idea of a superconductor-insulator (S/I)
      superlattice whose layers are coupled by Josephson tunnelling
      of quasiparticles. They modified the GL free-energy
      expression accordingly, and found an effective mass along the
      c-direction in terms of the tunnelling parameters. From this,
      following the work of Kats[<a href=
      "node66.html#kats69">127</a>], they showed that the critical
      field anisotropy was equal to the square root of the ratio of
      the effective masses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Klemm, Luther and Beasley[<a href=
      "node66.html#klemm75">131</a>] studied the GL equations with
      Josephson-coupling further, and found that they predicted a
      divergence of H<sub>c2, _|_ ^c</sub>(T) at a temperature
      T<sup>*</sup> given by <i>xi</i><sub>||
      ^c</sub>(T<sup>*</sup>) = s/<i>sqrt</i>2. In this equation, s
      is the interlayer spacing corresponding to I<sub>c</sub> in
      GIC's. KLB then did a first-principles calculation of
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>, T) and discovered that
      T<sup>*</sup> is actually the temperature at which a
      dimensionality crossover occurs. Dimensionality crossover in
      the context of layered superconductors means a change in
      character from bulklike behavior to film-like behavior. This
      change is caused by a decoupling of the superconducting
      layers from one another when <i>xi</i><sub>||^c</sub> becomes
      less than s. The symptoms of 2D behavior are that the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) curves are fit with Tinkham's
      formula rather than the AGL angular dependence formula, and
      that H<sub>c2</sub>(T) goes as (1 - t)<sup>1/2</sup> rather
      than the (1 - t) shape found near T<sub>c</sub> in 3D
      superconductors. This type of dimensionality crossover has
      been experimentally observed both in TMDCIC's[<a href=
      "node66.html#prober80">200</a>] and artificially structured
      superlattices (which are discussed in Chapter <a href=
      "node7.html#othersys"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      ).[<a href="node66.html#ruggiero82">208</a>] As an
      explanation for anomalies in superconducting GIC's,
      dimensionality crossover has a lot of appeal, since so many
      of the normal state properties of GIC's are
      quasi-two-dimensional. For example, the anisotropy of the
      conductivity in C<sub>4</sub>KHg is
      <i>sigma</i><sub>a</sub>/<i>sigma</i><sub>c</sub> 300.[<a
      href="node66.html#fischer83">85</a>]

      characterizes the dimensionality of coupling. <i>alpha</i>,

    <p>
      According to KLB, a layered superconductor will have the
      possibility of a coupling-dimensionality change when
      T<sup>*</sup> is greater than zero, which occurs when their
      parameter <b>r</b> is close to 1. The exact condition
      is<br />

    <p>

    <p>
      Calculated <b>r</b> values for a number of layered
      superconductors are shown in Tables <a href="#tmdcklb"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> and <a href=
      "#tmdcicklb"><img width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt=
      "gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. The r's for
      the GIC superconductors are shown in Fig. <a href=
      "node36.html#klbgics"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      As can easily be seen, many of the transition metal
      dichalcogenide superconductors and their intercalation
      compounds are expected to show the dimensionality crossover
      effect, and indeed many do, as was discussed in Section <a
      href="#tmdc"><img width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt=
      "gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>.[<a href=
      "node66.html#coleman83">46</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#prober80">200</a>] On the other hand, the known
      GIC superconductors are more than an order of magnitude away
      from the critical value of r. The KLB paper found no
      anomalies for <b>r</b> &gt;= 10,[<a href=
      "node66.html#klemm75">131</a>] as Fig. <a href=
      "node36.html#klbfig"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      shows. Therefore, dimensionality effects can safely be ruled
      out as having any impact on the critical fields of the known
      GIC superconductors. This is particularly interesting in
      light of the fact that many GIC's have anisotropies
      1/<i>epsilon</i> comparable to those of the TMDCIC's. For
      example, both C<sub>8</sub>KHg and
      TaS<sub>1.6</sub>Se<sub>0.4</sub> intercalated with collidine
      have anisotropies of about 30, yet the TMDCIC is expected to
      show a dimensionality crossover, and C<sub>8</sub>KHg is
      strongly three-dimensional even at 0 K.

    <p>
      At this juncture it is probably wise to discuss the
      proximity-coupled superlattice models of superconductivity[<a
      href="node66.html#biagi85">22</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#takahashi86b">235</a>], which have some
      similarities to the KLB model. These models are also capable
      of quantitatively explaining dimensional crossover, but in
      slightly different systems. Proximity-coupled superlattices
      are typically superconductor-normal-metal (SN) multilayers,
      while the Josephson-coupled superlattices described by the
      KLB theory are typically superconductor-insulator (S/I)
      multilayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motivation for making this distinction was originally
      explained by Werthamer, and separately by Saint-James and
      deGennes.[<a href="node66.html#werthamer63">261</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#degennes66">54</a>] At an S/I interface (the
      insulator may be vacuum), the pairs are confined in the
      superconductor so that they are almost unaffected by the
      presence of the boundary. In this case it is appropriate to
      ignore any variation of the order parameter within the
      superconducting layers, and to treat the interlayer coupling
      as due to Josephson tunnelling.[<a href=
      "node66.html#lawrence71">155</a>] On the other hand, at an
      S/N interface, the pairs can easily diffuse into the normal
      metal, where they will be destroyed.[<a href=
      "node66.html#degennes66">54</a>] The destruction of pairs at
      an S/N contact results in the suppression of the energy gap
      at the interface, and is one aspect of the proximity effect.
      Another aspect is that the superconductor can to some extent
      induce superconductivity in a thin layer of the normal
      metal.[<a href="node66.html#cooper61">49</a>] The
      proximity-coupled theories of Takahashi and Tachiki[<a href=
      "node66.html#takahashi86b">235</a>] and Biagi, Kogan, and
      Clem[<a href="node66.html#biagi85">22</a>] (BKC) were
      developed to treat the S/N case.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these models, the authors parameterize the S and N layers
      separately, unlike the KLB theory, where the properties of
      the insulating layers are ignored.[<a href=
      "node66.html#klemm75">131</a>] Takahashi and Tachiki[<a href=
      "node66.html#takahashi86b">235</a>] assign different
      densities of states N(0), diffusivities D, and BCS
      interaction energies V to the S and N layers. BKC, on the
      other hand, attribute to each type of layer a mean-free-path
      <i>l</i>, superconducting transition temperature
      T<sub>c</sub>, and Fermi velocity v<sub>F</sub>.[<a href=
      "node66.html#biagi85">22</a>] Because v <sub>F</sub> and
      <i>l</i> determine D, while N(0) and V determine (with
      <i>Omega</i><sub>D</sub>) T<sub>c</sub>, it seems that these
      parameterizations are more or less equivalent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The full theories both predict positive curvature of
      H<sub>c2</sub>(T). Takahashi and Tachiki found signs of a
      change in the coupling dimensionality for H<sub>c2, _|_
      ^c</sub>(T).[<a href="node66.html#takahashi86b">235</a>]
      Qualitatively these results are quite similar to those of
      KLB. The exact criteria for dimensional crossover are
      different, though: the authors say that the necessary
      condition for decoupling of the layers (at T <b>&gt;</b> 0)
      is s/ <i>xi</i><sub>|| ^c</sub>(0) &gt;= 0.4. This condition
      is equivalent, in terms of KLB's r-parameter, to <b>r</b>
      &lt;= 31.8. Thus the proximity-coupled multilayers decouple
      at longer coherence lengths (<i>xi</i><sub>|| ^c</sub> =
      2.5s) than the Josephson-coupled ones (<i>xi</i><sub>||
      ^c</sub> = 1.7s). Nonetheless, in the proximity-coupled
      superlattice models, no dimensionality change is anticipated
      for superconducting GIC's, which all exceed the limit in
      <b>r</b> by at least a factor of 2. (The possibility of
      dimensionality crossover in higher-stage GIC's is discussed
      in Section <a href="node61.html#concl"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>.) The source of this
      accelerated decoupling is not discussed in Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#takahashi86b">235</a>], but one can speculate
      that it comes from the suppression of the gap near the S/N
      interface by the proximity effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is even more intriguing for those interested in GIC's is
      the enhanced critical field found for <i>vec</i>H || ^c.
      BKC[<a href="node66.html#biagi85">22</a>] studied only this
      case, and found that ``the proximity effect alone can produce
      the positive curvature [PC] in H<sub>c2</sub>(T) ... [despite
      the fact that] no provisions were made for anisotropy or any
      other effects commonly thought to produce PC in
      H<sub>c2</sub>(T).'' These remarks are a little bit deceptive
      in that anisotropy has been implicitly introduced into the
      BKC model through the layer thickness parameters; that is,
      thin films are known to be anisotropic, and the individual
      layers have been chosen to be thin films. Nonetheless, it is
      impressive that positive curvature has been found in a
      superlattice formalism which is not linked to a
      dimensionality crossover. Takahashi and Tachiki also found PC
      for <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c.[<a href=
      "node66.html#takahashi86b">235</a>] These findings would seem
      to have important implications for GIC's, for whom a possible
      explanation of PC using dimensionality crossover has already
      been eliminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately there are several problems with applying the
      proximity-coupled superlattice models to GIC's. One objection
      is that assigning different mean-free-paths, diffusivities,
      T<sub>c</sub>'s and BCS interaction energies to the S and N
      layers seems a bit questionable when the layers are only a
      few atomic layers thick. These models were intended to be
      applied to S/N superlattices with layers on the order of a
      few-hundred &Aring; thick, where each of the constituents
      individually has transport properties which are little
      modified from the bulk. For layers on the order of 10 &Aring;
      thick, the transport properties are so modified from the
      pristine materials that use of the bulk parameters would be
      highly erroneous. The basic assumptions of the
      proximity-effect models are violated in GIC's, where the
      interaction between the host and intercalant is not a weak
      perturbation. Perhaps in the limit of very high-stage
      superconducting GIC's (if they exist!) agreement with the
      proximity-coupled description might be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second reason for discomfort with the KBC and Takahashi and
      Tachiki models is the idea that superconducting GIC's can be
      described as S/N superlattices. While Iye and Tanuma felt
      that superconductivity in the ternary GIC's was probably due
      to superconductivity in the intercalant layers,[<a href=
      "node66.html#iye82">120</a>] the idea that one component is
      superconducting and the other not appears somewhat shaky when
      <i>xi</i><sub>|| ^c</sub> 20 I<sub>c</sub>, as in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg. Also, as Al-Jishi pointed out, there is
      good reason to expect that the graphitic <i>pi</i>-bands
      contribute to superconductivity in GIC's, as otherwise their
      large critical field anisotropy is difficult to explain.[<a
      href="node66.html#M143">4</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      All these discussions are actually somewhat academic since
      the idea that GIC's are S/N superlattices turns out not to be
      self-consistent. The reason is that all proximity-effect
      theories[<a href="node66.html#cooper61">49</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#takahashi86b">235</a>] predict that the
      T<sub>c</sub>'s of S/N multilayers must always be less than
      the bulk transition temperature of the superconducting
      component. In fact, these models predict that, for small
      layer thicknesses, T<sub>c</sub> must decline monotonically
      with increasing thickness of the normal layer, all other
      parameters being held equal. The monotonic decrease of
      T<sub>c</sub> with increasing normal metal thickness is
      illustrated in Fig. <a href="node36.html#proxeff"><img width=
      "13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> for Pb/Cu bilayers.[<a
      href="node66.html#werthamer63">261</a>] Apparently no studies
      of T<sub>c</sub> versus normal metal thickness have been
      performed in metallic superlattices; the thicknesses of both
      the S and N components are usually varied together. (See
      Figure <a href="node9.html#assltc"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .) However, the
      depression of T<sub>c</sub> with increasing normal metal
      thickness is also expected in the superlattices. If one
      believes that only the intercalant layer is superconducting
      in GIC's, and thinks of the carbon (graphene) layer as a
      normal metal, then one would expect a decreasing
      T<sub>c</sub> with increasing stage. Yet, as is well-known,
      T<sub>c</sub> is higher in stage II than stage I for both
      KHg- and RbHg-GIC's,[<a href="node66.html#iye83">116</a>] in
      contravention to the expectation of the model.

      <i>infty</i>))(1 - <i>exp</i>-2D<sub>N</sub>/<i>xi</i>),
      where <i>xi</i> is the dirty-limit Pippard coherence
      length.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion is that, while the proximity-coupled models
      have been extremely successful in fitting data on
      artificially structured superlattices (for example, those of
      Nb/Ta[<a href="node66.html#broussard88">29</a>]), they do not
      seem to be well-suited to GIC's. Perhaps if high-stage
      superconducting GIC's are ever discovered, it might be
      worthwhile to take another look at proximity-coupling. For
      the known GIC's, though, it is imperative to consider
      alternative theories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though intuition says that the enhancement of the
      critical fields in superconducting GIC's is linked to their
      anisotropy, it is important to consider whether mechanisms
      not related to anisotropy could also play a role. The major
      causes of critical field enhancement in isotropic
      superconductors are spin-orbit scattering and strong-coupling
      behavior.
