      Besides the characterization measurements that were discussed
      in this chapter, several additional experiments were
      attempted that were not as successful. Among those attempted
      are optical transmission and resistivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Optical experiments are an obvious possibility considering
      that different T<sub>c</sub>'s correspond to different sample
      colors. The apparatus necessary to perform reflectivity
      measurements is not readily available at MIT, so it was
      decided to try transmission measurements instead.
      Transmission experiments on C<sub>8</sub>K and
      C<sub>24</sub>K were previously performed by Zhang and Eklund
      at the University of Kentucky.[<a href=
      "node66.html#zhang87">275</a>] The chief difficulty in
      optical transmission work with metals is getting a thin
      enough sheet that a measurable amount of light can actually
      be passed through. In fact, preparing even a transparent
      sheet of HOPG proved to be tough, let alone intercalating it
      in a intact condition. The lesson from these efforts is that
      reflectivity measurements would be much practical to perform
      if a suitable apparatus could be located.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another experiment for which a need is felt is
      low-temperature resistivity. Surprisingly, in-plane
      resistivity measurements have not been reported below 100 K
      on C<sub>4</sub>KHg,[<a href=
      "node66.html#elmakrini80">70</a>] even though c-axis
      resistivity data has been published down to liquid-helium
      temperature.[<a href="node66.html#fischer83">85</a>] The
      possibility of a charge-density wave in low- T<sub>c</sub>
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples[<a href=
      "node66.html#delong83">55</a>] provides plenty of motivation
      for performing this experiment. In addition, more information
      about normal-state transport would be helpful in order to
      compare the critical field data to existing theories.[<a
      href="node66.html#orlando79">186</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      One attempt was made to measure the in-plane resistivity of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg from room temperature to liquid-helium
      temperature. Four silver-paint leads were placed on the
      sample inside a glovebag, and the sample was sealed inside a
      glass-tube with epoxy, a technique developed by previous
      students.[<a href="node66.html#Z260">79</a>] Despite the fact
      that the leads did not pull off the a-face of the sample, and
      despite the fact that the sample showed no signs of
      discoloration or deintercalation, a resistivity about
      10<sup>4</sup> times the previously reported value of 20
      <i>mu</i> <i>Omega</i>-cm[<a href=
      "node66.html#elmakrini80b">72</a>] was measured at room
      temperature. The leads all appeared to have the same
      resistivity, so no obvious cause for the failure of this
      experiment could be identified. Perhaps silver paint is
      simply too reactive to use with C<sub>4</sub>KHg. The best
      idea would be to repeat this experiment using another contact
      medium, such as the gold paste that has been successfully
      used with C<sub>8</sub>K.[<a href=
      "node66.html#koike80">141</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the reflectivity and resistivity experiments still need
      to be performed on C<sub>4</sub>KHg. However, a lot has been
      learned about the samples used in the superconductivity
      experiments from characterization efforts that were
      successful. From the x-ray experiments, it was discovered
      that the low- T<sub>c</sub> and higher- T<sub>c</sub>
      specimens have approximately the same structure. Good
      agreement was found with the assertion of Timp[<a href=
      "node66.html#J140">248</a>] and Kim <em>et al.</em>[<a href=
      "node66.html#kim84">130</a>] that a temperature difference
      during intercalation produces less-ordered GIC's with a
      greater fraction of <i>beta</i> phase. It is worth noting
      that every specimen that showed any C<sub>4</sub>KHg peaks in
      x-rays was found to be superconducting with T<sub>c</sub>
      &gt;= 0.7 K.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neutron scattering experiments showed that the x-ray
      diffraction experiments were somewhat misleading, in that
      x-ray data sometimes indicated the presence of a single phase
      where neutrons indicated two phases. This finding may have
      important implications for understanding the hydrogenation
      experiments. Analysis of neutron diffraction data showed
      slight differences between gold and pink samples whose
      significance is not immediately clear. Good general agreement
      was found with the previous structural analysis of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg.[<a href="node66.html#yang84">272</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Raman scattering experiments on C<sub>4</sub>KHg showed no
      difference between the pink and gold phases with experimental
      error. This is despite the observation of zone-folded phases
      indicative of in-plane ordering by Timp.[<a href=
      "node66.html#N128">247</a>] The lack of zone-folded peaks in
      the recent Raman studies could be due to surface disorder
      stemming from laser-induced heating or slight accidental
      exposure to air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various measurements were also performed to find out the
      chemical composition of the specimens used for the
      low-temperature and diffraction experiments. The proposal
      that the low T<sub>c</sub> of gold C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples
      is caused by Hg deficiency[<a href=
      "node66.html#H242">207</a>] does not seem to hold up. In
      fact, support is found for the idea that the low-
      T<sub>c</sub> phase has a higher mercury/potassium ratio,[<a
      href="node66.html#yang84">272</a>] although other factors are
      probably also important.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CsBi-GIC's used in the low-temperature studies appear to
      be very similar to those made in other laboratories. The
      x-ray and electron[<a href="node66.html#speck88z">222</a>]
      diffraction patterns, color, and chemical composition from
      RBS all agree with the results reported by Lagrange and
      coworkers,[<a href="node66.html#lagrange87">145</a>] the
      original discoverers of these new materials. T<sub>c</sub>
      measurements on CsBi-GIC's are described in Section <a href=
      "node52.html#csbitc"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
    </p>
    <p>
      In general the current study of the synthesis of KHg- and
      CsBi-GIC's has confirmed the findings of previous
      investigators.[<a href="node66.html#lagrange87">145</a>,<a
      href="node66.html#J140">248</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#yang84">272</a>] Extensive characterization
      efforts have allowed the identification of some correlations
      between the structural and chemical properties of a GIC and
      its superconductivity. The superconductivity measurements are
      described in detail in the following chapters.
