    <p>
      <a id="typeI" name="typeI">&nbsp;</a> The three factors
      described above, namely sample tilt, mosaic spread, and
      critical field definition, are the extrinsic influences which
      may affect the shape of H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>). None of
      these is thought to have a large effect on the data. There
      are also more fundamental, intrinsic explanations for the
      disparity between data and fit. Probably the most applicable
      of these to C<sub>4</sub>KHg is the conceivable existence of
      type I superconductivity for field orientations near
      <i>theta</i> = 0&deg;. Type I superconductivity for 0&deg;
      &lt;= <i>theta</i> &lt;= 25&deg; has been previously reported
      for C<sub>8</sub>K by several groups[<a href=
      "node66.html#kobayashi81a">137</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#kobayashi81">136</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#koike80">141</a>]. C<sub>9.4</sub>K[<a href=
      "node66.html#kobayashi81a">137</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#kobayashi81">136</a>] and C<sub>8</sub>Rb[<a
      href="node66.html#kobayashi85">133</a>], on the other hand,
      are found to be type I for all field directions. The
      existence of type I character for a range of angles in
      layered superconductors was predicted even before its
      experimental discovery by Kats.[<a href=
      "node66.html#kats69">127</a>] For these reasons the question
      of type I superconductivity in C<sub>4</sub>KHg should be
      approached with an open mind, despite the type II
      superconductivity reported for all field orientations in Ref.
      [<a href="node66.html#iye82">120</a>].

       <strong>Figure:</strong> H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) for
      C<sub>8</sub>K, from Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#koike80">141</a>]. The fields are labeled
      H<sub>c2</sub> in the type II region and H<sub>c3</sub> and
      H<sub>c</sub> in the type I region.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Iye and Tanuma concluded that there is no type I
      superconductivity in C<sub>4</sub>KHg because they did not
      observe supercooling in their field sweeps for any angle
      <i>theta</i>.[<a href="node66.html#iye82">120</a>] However,
      the presence of supercooling and the differential
      paramagnetic effect (DPE) are not the only criteria for the
      determination of the type of superconductivity. Another
      approach to the question is to look at the Ginzburg-Landau
      <i>kappa</i> parameter since <i>kappa</i> = 1/<i>sqrt</i>2 is
      the critical value dividing type I and type II
      superconductors. <i>kappa</i> can be estimated using specific
      heat and critical field data through use of the following
      formulae:[<a href="node66.html#tinkham80">252</a>]<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="kappadef" name="kappadef">&nbsp;</a><img align=
      "bottom" alt="" src="img57.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      where <i>Lambda</i> is the magnetic field penetration depth,
      <i>xi</i> is the coherence length, H<sub>c</sub>(0) is the
      zero-temperature thermodynamic critical field, and
      <i>Gamma</i> is the normal-state linear electronic specific
      heat coefficient. The equality between <i>kappa</i> and
      <i>kappa</i><sub>1</sub> is good to within about 20%,[<a
      href="node66.html#eilenberger67">69</a>] so we can use
      <i>kappa</i><sub>1</sub> as a rough esimate of <i>kappa</i>.
      (In the discussion below, what is referred to as <i>kappa</i>
      has actually been calculated using the definition of
      <i>kappa</i><sub>1</sub>.) Because <i>Gamma</i> has been
      measured for C<sub>4</sub>KHg,[<a href=
      "node66.html#alexander81">8</a>] one can estimate
      <i>kappa</i>(0) by calculating H<sub>c</sub>(0) and linearly
      extrapolating H<sub>c2</sub>(T) to zero temperature. The
      applicability of this procedure to the T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K
      GIC's is uncertain because no superconducting transition was
      observed down to 0.8 K in the samples on which <i>Gamma</i>
      was measured. It seems possible that <i>Gamma</i> could be
      different in the T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K and T<sub>c</sub> =
      0.7 K samples, even though it is a property of the normal
      state. Also, <i>Gamma</i> was given in Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#alexander81">8</a>] in molar units, so in order
      to convert to cgs units one must calculate the molar volume,
      which means that one must assume a structure for the
      compound. Here a (2 &times; 2)R0&deg; in-plane unit cell is
      employed, since this is the structure which has most
      frequently been observed in C<sub>4</sub>KHg.[<a href=
      "node66.html#kamitakahara84">123</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#K167">246</a>] (See Figure <a href=
      "node6.html#c8kstruct"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      .) Despite these caveats, since no other measurement of the
      specific heat is available, it is useful to see what can be
      learned by estimating <i>kappa</i>. The results of this
      calculation are given in Table <a href=
      "node30.html#kappatable"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      for three MIT C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples and three from Ref.
      [<a href="node66.html#iye82">120</a>]. Notice that the
      magnitude of <i>kappa</i> is generally lower for the higher-
      T<sub>c</sub> specimens. The implication is that type I
      transitions are more likely to be observed in the higher-
      T<sub>c</sub> GIC's.

       <strong>Table:</strong> Calculated values of <i>kappa</i>
      for selected C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples. The H<sub>c2</sub>(0)
      numbers come from linear extrapolation of the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(T) data (see Section <a href=
      "node34.html#hvstdata"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>),
      and so are independent of the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)
      measurements.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The meaning of <i>kappa</i> will be discussed in more detail
      below, but for the moment it suffices to say that
      <i>kappa</i><sub>|| ^c</sub> tend to be quite close to
      <i>kappa</i><sub>critical</sub> = 0.707. The primary
      conclusion from this calculation is that within the
      uncertainty of the approximations made, the type of the
      superconductivity in C<sub>4</sub>KHg is indeterminate, but
      that it could very well be type I for some samples for
      <i>theta</i> close to zero. This is especially true at higher
      temperatures since, according to the two-fluid model:[<a
      href="node66.html#tinkham80">252</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      <img align="bottom" alt="" src="img59.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      where <b>t</b> is the reduced temperature. Thus it seems
      quite likely that the presence of type I superconductivity is
      a factor in explaining the poor fits obtained to
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data with Equation <a href=
      "node28.html#ldtheor"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      at least in some specimens at higher temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <i>kappa</i><sub>|| ^c</sub> decreases with increasing
      temperature, the angular range in which type I behavior
      occurs should increase as t increases. The variation of the
      angular range of type I character is observed in TaN, the
      only non-GIC bulk material known to display type I or type II
      character depending on field orientation.[<a href=
      "node66.html#weber78">259</a>] Some
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) at constant temperature curves
      for TaN are shown in Figure <a href="node30.html#TaN"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. In the bottom trace, at
      T = 1.65 K, TaN is type II for all angles, as the excellent
      agreement with the dashed fit indicates. When the temperature
      is increased to 1.8 K, the sample has type I character near
      the [100] direction, with the result that the data there
      deviate above the dashed curve. When the temperature increase
      to 2.1 K, the measured critical field for almost all angles
      <i>theta</i> is H<sub>c</sub>, and when the temperature
      reaches 2.4 K, the sample is type I for all orientations.
      C<sub>8</sub>K might also be type I for all orientations for
      temperatures sufficiently close to T<sub>c</sub>. The change
      with temperature of the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) fits for
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg is qualitatively similar, although less
      dramatic, since type II behavior persists for a much larger
      range of angles. For the higher- T<sub>c</sub>
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimens, the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)
      curves are probably most comparable to the 1.8 K TaN trace in
      Figure <a href="node30.html#TaN"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />

       <strong>Figure:</strong> H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) curves
      for TaN showing a transition from type I to type II character
      as a function of field direction. From Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#weber78">259</a>]. TaN is the only bulk
      superconductor besides C<sub>8</sub>K (and possibly
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg) known to display this variability. The
      temperatures at which the curves were taken and the
      thermodynamic critical fields are indicated. Note that at
      1.65 K, the sample is entirely type II, but that at 2.4 K it
      is entirely type I.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      If the angular range of type I behavior increases with
      temperature, then the agreement between Eqn. <a href=

      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      and the C<sub>4</sub>KHg data should deteriorate as the
      temperature increases. The validity of this assertion is
      demonstrated by Figure <a href="node30.html#thetatemp"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=

      (1/<i>epsilon</i>) = 4.5, and <i>cal</i> R = 1.43.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      If type I superconductivity is indeed present in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg, this fact should be accounted for in
      fitting the data. In Figure <a href="node30.html#hctemp"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>, new fits are shown in
      which the theoretical curve has the form:<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="typeItheta" name="typeItheta">&nbsp;</a><img align=
      "bottom" alt="" src="img62.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea behind using this functional form is that if
      H<sub>c</sub> is greater than H<sub>c2</sub>, then
      H<sub>c</sub> will presumably be measured as the critical
      field. A quick comparison of Figs. <a href=
      "node30.html#thetatemp"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      and <a href="node30.html#hctemp"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> shows that inclusion of H<sub>c</sub> as a parameter
      dramatically improves the quality of the fits at all
      temperatures. This large improvement is in contrast to the
      small (or negative) impact on the quality of fit of the
      mosaic spread and tilt parameters. Residuals for the fits
      with and without type I behavior are gathered in Table <a
      href="node32.html#residsum"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> . The improvement in the residual index is not accounted
      for simply by the addition of another free parameter since
      the number of parameters is taken into account in the
      definition of <i>cal</i> R (see Eqn. <a href=
      "node28.html#residef"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>).

       <strong>Figure:</strong> Anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau model
      fits (dotted curves) to H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data as
      a function of temperature, taking into account the
      possibility of type I behavior. All fits were produced with
      the parameters tilt = 0&deg; and mosaic spread = 0&deg;. a) t
      = 0.29, H<sub>c2,||^c</sub> = 35 Oe, anisotropy

      = 12.5, H<sub>c</sub> = 24.5 Oe, and <i>cal</i> R =
      1.11.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For these new fits, H<sub>c</sub> was taken as a free
      parameter. The numbers obtained for the thermodynamic
      critical field from the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) fits for
      two samples are shown in Table <a href=
      "node30.html#htherm_table"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      and H<sub>c</sub>(T) is plotted in Figure <a href=
      "node30.html#hcfig"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      According to the BCS theory, H<sub>c</sub>(T) should be
      quadratic, having the form (1 - t<sup>2</sup>). The fact that
      the H<sub>c</sub> values found from the angular dependence
      are better fit by a straight line is somewhat disturbing,
      since (1 - t) behavior is expected for H<sub>c2</sub>(T) (see
      Section <a href="node34.html#hvstdata"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ). However,
      H<sub>c</sub>(T) showed <em>positive curvature</em> in
      C<sub>8</sub>K (see Figure <a href="node39.html#c6k"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ), where signs of type I
      superconductivity (large hysteresis and differential
      paramagnetic effect) were unmistakable.[<a href=
      "node66.html#koike80">141</a>] Since the temperature
      dependence of H<sub>c2</sub>(T) is unusual in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg, perhaps it is not straining credibility too
      much to suggest that H<sub>c</sub>(T) could be anomalous,
      too, just as in C<sub>8</sub>K.
    </p>
    <p>
      The obvious question is whether these values of the critical
      field are consistent with those calculated from the specific
      heat measurements, also given in the table. The calculated
      thermodynamic critical field tends to be about 1.8 times the
      fit one. The most likely explanation for this inconsistency
      is that the value of <i>Gamma</i> quoted in Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#alexander81">8</a>] is simply too high. For the
      reasons mentioned above, a higher value of <i>Gamma</i> for
      the sample of Ref. [<a href="node66.html#alexander81">8</a>]
      would not be very surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another possible explanation for the difference in magnitude
      of H<sub>c</sub> is that up to this point the demagnetization
      factor <i>cal</i> D has not been taken into account. (1 -
      <i>cal</i> D) H<sub>c</sub> is the field where normal regions
      are first formed.[<a href="node66.html#tinkham80">252</a>,<a
      href="node66.html#livingston69">157</a>] Thus, the ideal type
      of magnetization curve shown in Figure <a href=
      "node23.html#figmeiss"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> a
      is found only for ideal samples with <i>cal</i> D = 0; in
      real specimens the sharp corner is rounded. The number, size,
      and shape of the normal regions formed for (1 - <i>cal</i> D)
      H<sub>c</sub> ;SPM<sub>l</sub>t; H<sub>applied</sub>
      ;SPM<sub>l</sub>t; H<sub>c</sub> depends typically on sample
      size, shape, defects, and orientation with respect to the
      applied field.[<a href="node66.html#livingston69">157</a>]
      The primary effect of a non-zero demagnetization factor then
      is to change the shape of the transition with angle. Because
      of the method of critical field determination used here (see
      Figure <a href="node27.html#hc2def"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> b), the possible
      influence of demagnetization on the transition shape cannot
      be completely ruled out. Therefore, demagnetization-induced
      distortion could be causing the measured critical field to be
      substantially less than the actual value of H<sub>c</sub>.
      The influence of demagnetization effects should be
      particularly strong for the conditions used in the study of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg, since for thin plates in a transverse field
      (here <i>vec</i>H || ^c) <i>cal</i> D 1.0, meaning that the
      samples are effectively always in the intermediate state.[<a

      Ideally it would be possible to obtain the demagnetization
      factor as a function of angle in order to correct the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) and H<sub>c</sub>(T) curves.
      Past experimentalists have gotten a value for <i>cal</i> D by
      machining a material with known critical fields to the size
      and shape of the sample.[<a href=
      "node66.html#denhoff82">59</a>] Then one gets <i>cal</i> D by
      comparing the measured critical fields of the machined
      specimen to the known values for shapes with zero
      demagnetization. Unfortunately this procedure would have to
      be carried out for each specimen. If a reliable calculation
      of <i>cal</i> D were available, it would also allow a more
      rigorous testing of the theory. However, since the
      demagnetization is strongly dependent on the sample
      dimensions[<a href="node66.html#denhoff82">59</a>] and
      because <i>cal</i> D could easily be affected by such
      hard-to-quantify factors as exfoliation, the amount of effort
      required does not seem worthwhile. Any use of a value for the
      demagnetization would also require the introduction of
      several new parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ideal type I superconductor should be easy to distinguish
      from a type II superconductor because of the discontinuity in
      its magnetization at &lt;=ft| <i>vec</i>H <i>|</i> =
      H<sub>c</sub>. (See Figure <a href=
      "node23.html#figmeiss"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>).
      However, a non-zero demagnetization factor can smear out the
      magnetization curve, making even type I transitions appear
      more or less continuous. Despite the presence of
      demagnetization effects, it seems sensible to examine the
      field sweeps to see if there is any evidence of discontinuity
      under the conditions where type I behavior is suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lower- T<sub>c</sub> C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples (whose
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) curves were well-fit by Eqn. <a
      href="node28.html#ldtheor"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      ), the experimental traces appear smooth for all angles, as
      Figure <a href="node30.html#transhape"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>a) shows. The only major
      difference between <i>theta</i> = 90&deg; and <i>theta</i> =
      0&deg; is that the high-angle transitions are considerably
      broader, for reasons discussed in Section <a href=
      "node24.html#critfexp"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      This result is consistent with the finding that these samples
      were type II for all orientations, and is consistent with Iye
      and Tanuma's findings.[<a href="node66.html#iye82">120</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      In the T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K samples, the field sweeps for
      <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c look smooth, just as they do for the
      lower- T<sub>c</sub> GIC's. For <i>vec</i>H || ^c, on the
      other hand, the curves appear fairly continuous on the
      upsweep, but develop a corner near the upper critical field
      on the downsweep which could be identified as a
      discontinuity. The arrow in Figure <a href=
      "node30.html#transhape"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      b) indicates the location of the corner. While it is tempting
      to identify this corner as a discontinuity stemming from a
      first-order transition, it is a fairly small feature.
      Therefore, the evidence regarding type I versus type II
      behavior from the field sweeps is suggestive but ambiguous.
      Low-temperature magnetization measurements would probably be
      easier to interpret than susceptibility in this regard, but
      unfortunately there was no readily available magnetometer
      that could be cooled to the necessary 1 K range.

      Why should the lower- T<sub>c</sub> specimens be type II for
      all orientations, and the higher- T<sub>c</sub> ones be type
      I for some orientations? The superficial answer is that
      H<sub>c2</sub> isn't as strongly T<sub>c</sub>-dependent as
      might be expected, since the critical fields of the
      T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K samples are only slightly higher than
      those of the T<sub>c</sub> = 0.7 K samples. (Refer to Table
      <a href="node30.html#kappatable"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> for the relevant numbers.) If H<sub>c</sub> increases as
      T<sub>c</sub><sup>2</sup> and H<sub>c2</sub> increases only
      weakly with T<sub>c</sub>, the net result must be a decrease
      in <i>kappa</i> with increasing T<sub>c</sub>. The deeper
      answer to the question is that <i>xi</i> and <i>Lambda</i>,
      the lengths whose ratio determines <i>kappa</i>, are both
      affected by changes in v<sub>F</sub> and <i>l</i>, the Fermi
      velocity and the mean-free-path.[<a href=
      "node66.html#orlando79">186</a>] Therefore, one can invoke
      differences between the two sample types either in the Fermi
      surface or in crystalline perfection to explain dissimilarity
      of their critical fields. Of course, the same mechanism
      should ideally also explain their different zero-field
      transition temperatures. Since the lower- T<sub>c</sub> gold
      specimens have broader zero-field superconducting transitions
      than the higher- T<sub>c</sub> pink samples (see Table <a
      href="node20.html#tcfreq"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      ), it seems natural to think that the gold samples are less
      well-ordered. This line of reasoning implies that the gold
      specimens have a lower mean-free-path. The differences
      between the gold and pink samples are discussed at length in
      Chapter <a href="node40.html#hydrog"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> . In the meantime, the
      implications of possible type I superconductivity in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg deserve further consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another good question about the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)
      curves is why the data are not perfectly flat near
      <i>theta</i> = 0 if the measured critical field is
      H<sub>c</sub> there. Some angular dependence of H<sub>c</sub>
      is also present in the TaN data of Figure <a href=
      "node30.html#TaN"><img width="13" height="13" align="bottom"
      alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. As was
      first suggested by P. Tedrow[<a href=
      "node66.html#tedrow88">242</a>], the angular dependence of
      the demagnetization factor could influence the shape of the
      field sweeps enough to cause a perceived angular dependence
      of H<sub>c</sub>. Koike <em>et al.</em>[<a href=
      "node66.html#koike80">141</a>] in their study of
      C<sub>8</sub>K also noticed a small angular dependence of
      H<sub>c</sub> near <i>theta</i> = 0 (see Figure <a href=
      "node30.html#Khc2theta"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      ). In addition, they measured a strongly angle-dependent
      supercooling field which they thought must be H<sub>c3</sub>,
      the surface nucleation field. However, H<sub>c3</sub> is not
      angle-dependent in the sense indicated in Figure <a href=
      "node30.html#Khc2theta"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ;
      it is in fact equal to 1.69 H<sub>c2</sub>(theta), but here
      <i>theta</i> is the angle between the crystal surface and the
      c-axis, not the angle between the applied field and the
      c-axis.[<a href="node66.html#orlando88">187</a>] Thus
      H<sub>c3</sub>(<i>theta</i>) can only be measured by
      preparing different crystals with differently oriented
      surfaces, not by turning the applied magnetic field.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another problem with the identification of the
      angle-dependent supercoooling field with H<sub>c3</sub>. The
      problem is that H<sub>c3</sub> is the surface nucleation
      field for a field applied <em>parallel</em> to the
      surface,[<a href="node66.html#degennes66">54</a>], while
      <i>vec</i>H || ^c corresponds to the field
      <em>perpendicular</em> to the surface. In some anisotropic
      Chevrel phases with an unusual grain structure,
      H<sub>c3</sub> has been seen for the ``wrong'' orientation,
      but for HOPG-based GIC's such as the ones studied by Koike
      and coworkers, no such microstructural anomalies are
      anticipated.[<a href="node66.html#orlando88">187</a>]
      Therefore the identification of the supercooling field || ^c
      with H<sub>c3</sub> must be mistaken. It seems likely that
      the angular dependence of the supercooling field reported in
      Ref. [<a href="node66.html#koike80">141</a>] is a
      demagnetization-derived effect, along with the slight angular
      dependence of H<sub>c</sub> observed in C<sub>8</sub>K[<a
      href="node66.html#koike80">141</a>] and C<sub>8</sub>Rb[<a
      href="node66.html#kobayashi85a">134</a>]. Certainly the
      change in the demagnetization <i>cal</i> D (from 1 for vecH
      perpendicular to a plate to 0 for <i>vec</i>H parallel to a
      plate) is large enough to cause this apparent angular
      dependence.[<a href="node66.html#tedrow88">242</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#tinkham80">252</a>]
