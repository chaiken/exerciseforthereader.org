    <p>
      The original intention of the neutron scattering experiments
      was to do a full structure determination of the different
      phases of C<sub>4</sub>KHg through Rietvelt analysis of a
      powder diffraction pattern. Unfortunately, the neutron
      absorption cross-section of mercury is so high that taking a
      powder pattern turns out to be impractical.[<a href=
      "node66.html#neumann88">184</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The next idea was to look at (hk0) in-plane diffraction rings
      for the two types of C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples. It was
      anticipated that the lower- T<sub>c</sub> gold samples might
      show less in-plane ordering, or perhaps simply a different
      intercalant arrangement, and that this arrangement would
      change during <em>in situ</em> hydrogen exposure. Because
      neutrons are sensitive to hydrogen, unlike x-rays or
      electrons, this experiment could even allow the determination
      of the hydrogen positions, should they be ordered. Both the
      <i>alpha</i> and <i>beta</i> phases were seen using neutron
      diffraction by Kim and coworkers[<a href=
      "node66.html#kim84">130</a>] and Kamitakahara and
      coworkers,[<a href="node66.html#kamitakahara84b">124</a>] so
      the prospects for success of this experiment seemed quite
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to have sufficient intensity to see the desired
      (hk0) peaks within a reasonable amount of data collection
      time, large samples are required. Initial attempts to
      synthesize HOPG samples of the size (2&times;2&times;0.05)
      cm<sup>3</sup> were unsuccessful because of severe
      inhomogeneities, much greater than those found in smaller
      samples. The intercalation compounds formed after 4 or 5
      weeks in the furnace were black and still 0.05 cm thick on
      one end, and obviously gold (or pink) and quite thick on the
      other end. Despite the fact that these samples (5 batches of
      them) were somewhat intercalated, they showed no (00<i>l</i>)
      x-ray peaks, and so were deemed unacceptable for neutron
      diffraction. Interestingly, small HOPG pieces and Madagascar
      graphite flakes in the same intercalation ampoule formed
      well-ordered C<sub>4</sub>KHg. Presumably the big pieces did
      not intercalate uniformly because of small temperature
      gradients across the graphite. In order to prevent thermal
      gradients from developing, the large HOPG pieces in the
      second set of batches were packed in glass wool inside the
      intercalation ampoule. These batches were left in the furnace
      for about six weeks. The specimens from the second set of
      batches looked more uniformly intercalated than those from
      the initial attempts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The samples were mounted in special gas-loading cans
      compatible with cryostats of the type designed at the
      Institut Laue-Langevin. These cryostats are similar to normal
      liquid-helium ones, such as the Janus Varitemp dewar, except
      that they have aluminum ``windows'' at the bottom for the
      admission of neutrons. The gas-loading cans were designed by
      Dr. D. Neumann of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) to
      allow the admission of up to ten atmospheres gauge pressure
      of gas, more than enough for the hydrogenation experiment.
      (The details of the hydrogenation experiment are discussed in
      Chapter 5.) The samples were affixed with aluminum foil or
      vacuum grease inside thin rectangular aluminum chambers at
      the bottom of the cans. The chambers had indium o-ring seals.
      The rest of the gas-loading can consisted of a series of
      valves and 1/8" stainless-steel tubing connected to the
      sample chamber with standard Cajon VCR fittings.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the GIC's were mounted in the cans, they were
      transported to NBS in Gaithersburg, Maryland, where they were
      examined using the BT-4 triple-axis neutron diffractometer.
      Thermal neutrons of wavelength 1.528 &Aring; were
      monochromated by reflection off an HOPG polycrystal and
      collimated with standard neutron optics. The diffracted beam
      was counted by a <sup>3</sup>He detector which was interfaced
      to a PDP-11 lab computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately on the first trip to NBS, no large
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples had been produced which had
      (00<i>l</i>) x-rays. Therefore, small HOPG-based specimens
      which had been used in the low-temperature measurements were
      used instead. On the second trip to NBS, there were problems
      with the reactor, and so no data was taken due to the lack of
      neutrons. By the time neutrons were available (about 3
      weeks), the samples had gone bad, probably due to slow leaks
      through the indium seals. Thus the only data that was taken
      was on small (3mm &times; 3mm &times; 1 mm) GIC's, which
      prevented the observation of (hk0) rings or inelastic phonon
      peaks. The neutron diffraction data consists of (00<i>l</i>)
      scans on a pink sample, a gold sample, a gold sample with
      hydrogen, and a gold sample with deuterium. In addition,
      rocking scans were performed to measure the mosaic spread of
      each specimen. The mosaic spread of these HOPG-based
      specimens varied between 1.7&deg; and 2.7&deg;, which are
      fairly typical values for GIC's.[<a href=
      "node66.html#neumann88">184</a>] (00<i>l</i>) x-ray and
      neutron spectra for the unhydrogenated gold sample are shown
      in Figure 3.7.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
       <strong>Figure 3.7:</strong> X-ray and neutron diffraction
      (00<i>l</i>) spectra of a gold C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimen. The
      <i>beta</i>-phase peaks are marked with <i>downarrow</i>. a)
      Only the I<sub>c</sub> = 10.24 &Aring; <i>alpha</i> phase is
      clearly visible using x-rays. The small bump to the left of
      the (002) may be the <i>beta</i>-phase (002) peak. b) With
      neutrons, both the I<sub>c</sub> = 10.24 &Aring; <i>alpha</i>
      phase and the I<sub>c</sub> = 10.83 &Aring; <i>beta</i> phase
      show well-defined peaks.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The neutron diffraction pattern shown in Figure 3.7b) implies
      that the <i>beta</i>-phase constitutes about 10% of the
      specimen. This is somewhat surprising since the x-ray data in
      Figure 3.7b) shows only one set of peaks. A careful scrutiny
      of the x-ray spectrum allows one to identify a candidate for
      the <i>beta</i>-phase (002) peak, but nonetheless one would
      guess from the x-ray data that the <i>beta</i>-phase is
      present only in a very small amount. The unexpected presence
      of the <i>beta</i>-phase in this sample invites the question,
      Do all gold samples contain some <i>beta</i> phase? It seems
      that x-rays are insufficient to answer this question. Partly
      this is due to the scattering of the x-rays by the
      sample-encapsulating tube, but it is also partly due to the
      limited skin depth of x-rays. Timp made a related comment in
      reference to his magnetoresistance measurements: ``...the
      conventional (00<i>l</i>) x-ray diffraction-characterization
      technique is an inadequate measure of the homogeneity of the
      staging order for SdH measurements, because the
      magnetoresistance measurement for homogeneous sytems is
      sensitive to the bulk properties of the compound while
      molybdenum K<sub><i>alpha</i></sub> x-ray radiation has an
      extinction depth of only 35 <i>mu</i>m (in stage-1
      KHg-GIC's).''[<a href="node66.html#W179">245</a>] The lack of
      correlation between the (00<i>l</i>) x-rays and T<sub>c</sub>
      suggests that Timp's comments about magnetoresistance apply
      equally well to superconductivity. Thermal neutrons, on the
      other hand, have a penetration depth of about one centimeter,
      which is more than enough to see the whole thickness of a
      GIC.[<a href="node66.html#neumann88">184</a>] The idea that
      all gold stage I KHg-GIC's contain the <i>beta</i> phase may
      be important for understanding the hydrogenation experiments,
      as discussed in Chapter 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attempt was made to add hydrogen to the gold sample whose
      spectrum is shown in Figure 3.7. Unfortunately the peaks of
      the sample could not be found after its transfer from a glass
      tube to a gas-loading can. This transfer was probably
      unsuccessful because there was no glovebox available at NBS,
      and the transfer is too time-consuming for a glovebag.
      Instead of the <em>in situ</em> hydrogen addition, a gold
      specimen which had already been exposed to hydrogen was
      studied without transfer to a gas-loading can. The
      (00<i>l</i>) data from this sample, whose T<sub>c</sub> was
      0.84 K before hydrogenation and 1.54 K afterward, are shown
      in Figure 3.8a). The (00<i>l</i>) peaks of an unhydrogenated
      pink C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimen are presented for comparison
      in Figure 3.8b). These spectra are believed to be the first
      neutron diffraction scans on C<sub>4</sub>KHg which show only
      the <i>alpha</i> phase; previous experiments by Yang[<a href=
      "node66.html#yang84">272</a>] and Kim[<a href=
      "node66.html#kim84">130</a>] showed both <i>alpha</i> and
      <i>beta</i> phase peaks, just as Figure 3.7b) does. The
      spectrum of the deuterated sample is not shown here because
      these data were marred by problems with sample motion during
      the scan, while the other neutron scans were unaffected by
      sample movement.

      T<sub>c</sub> was 0.84 K before hydrogenation and 1.54 K

    </p>
    <p>
      The two spectra shown in Figure 3.8 do not look very
      different from one another. In fact, none of the three
      neutron diffraction patterns shown here look very different
      from one another except for the presence of the
      <i>beta</i>-phase peaks in the gold sample without hydrogen.
      In order to be able to intercompare the spectra in a more
      quantitative way, the integrated intensities of the
      diffraction patterns were fit to a 5-layer model[<a href=
      "node66.html#lagrange83a">151</a>] of the unit cell, using a
      gradient-least squares optimization algorithm to obtain the
      residual-minimizing parameters. Only the majority
      <i>alpha</i>-phase intensities were fit because the number of
      peaks in the <i>beta</i> phase was too small.
    </p>
    <p>
      The method used to fit the integrated intensities is a
      standard one, and is similar to that used by Yang and
      coworkers to fit their C<sub>4</sub>KHg neutron data.[<a
      href="node66.html#yang84">272</a>] Essentially the method is
      the following: the data are converted to relative structure
      factors F<sup>exp</sup> by dividing the integrated
      intensities through by the intensity of the highest peak. The
      experimental relative structure factors are then compared to
      the calculated ones, which are obtained from<br />

    </p>
    <p>
      where the sum is taken over the 6 layers of the model. Thus
      the subscript i stands for the properties of the element in
      layer i. A <sub>i</sub> is the neutron scattering factor of
      the element in layer i, N <sub>i</sub> is its stoichiometry
      (with respect to carbon = 4), B <sub>i</sub> is its
      Debye-Waller factor, <i>theta</i><sub><i>l</i></sub> is the
      diffraction angle, <i>Lambda</i> is the wavelength of the
      neutrons, and z <sub>i</sub> is the c-axis position of the
      ith layer with respect to the center of the sandwich. The
      definitions of the various layer positions are illustrated in
      Figure 3.9.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
       <strong>Figure 3.9:</strong> Definition of the distances
      z<sub>i</sub> used in the fits to the neutron diffraction
      data (from Ref. [<a href="node66.html#yang84">272</a>]). The
      distances are measured from the center of the sandwich,
      halfway between the mercury layers. <i>Delta</i>z, the Hg
      layer splitting, is twice the distance of the Hg layers from
      z = 0.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the theoretical structure factors were calculated using
      a given set of parameters and Eqn. 3.1, the quality of fit
      was quantified using a standard expression for the residual
      parameter <i>R</i>.[<a href=
      "node66.html#hamilton65">101</a>]The definition of R used
      here weights the individual structure factors by their
      experimental uncertainties, and is considered superior.[<a
      href="node66.html#ali88">128</a>] The <i>R</i> used here is
      called the normalized standard deviation and is given by:[<a
      href="node66.html#hamilton65">101</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      <img width="509" height="81" align="bottom" alt="" src=
      "neutronres.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Here F<sub><i>l</i></sub><sup>exp</sup> is the observed
      structure factor, F<sub><i>l</i></sub><sup>calc</sup> is the
      calculated structure factor, and w<sub><i>l</i></sub> is the
      experimental uncertainty in
      F<sub><i>l</i></sub><sup>exp</sup>. This experimental
      uncertainty comes from instrumental factors and the height of
      the background in the spectrum. The definition of the
      residual in Equation 3.2 is different from that used by Yang
      and coworkers.[<a href="node66.html#yang84">272</a>]
      Therefore the new residuals reported here should not be
      compared with those of Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#yang84">272</a>], but should only be used for
      intercomparison. A gradient least-squares routine[<a href=
      "node66.html#bevington69">21</a>] was used to optimize the
      parameters by minimizing the magnitude of <i>R</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the parameters used to calculate the structure
      factors were known beforehand. The neutron scattering lengths
      A <sub>i</sub> can be found in any standard nuclear data
      reference book,[<a href="node66.html#mughabghab73">177</a>]
      and the Debye-Waller factors were taken from the work of Yang
      and coworkers.[<a href="node66.html#yang84">272</a>] These
      Debye-Waller factors were B<sub>C</sub> = 1.66
      &Aring;<sup>2</sup>, B<sub>K</sub> = 0.78
      &Aring;<sup>2</sup>, and B<sub>Hg</sub> = 4.75
      &Aring;<sup>2</sup>. I<sub>c</sub> was found from the peak
      positions in the (00<i>l</i>) scans, and so was not used as a
      parameter in fitting the integrated intensities. The
      potassium atoms scatter neutrons so weakly compared to carbon
      and mercury that the K positions and stoichiometry have only
      a small effect on the fit. Therefore the K/C relative
      stoichiometry was fixed at 0.25. The remaining parameters
      were z<sub>K</sub>, the position of the potassium layer,
      <i>Delta</i>z, the position of the mercury layer, and N
      <sub>Hg</sub>, the stoichiometry of the mercury layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Table 3.3, the values of these parameters obtained from
      fits to the diffraction patterns shown in Figures 3.7 and 3.8
      are compared with the numbers found by Yang <em>et
      al.</em>[<a href="node66.html#yang84">272</a>] The residual
      index found for the fit to the pink sample's data is 0.036,
      while that found for the gold sample is 0.044.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img width="500" height="372" src="table3.3.png" /><br />
       <strong>Table 3.3:</strong> Parameters obtained from fits to
      the C<sub>4</sub>KHg neutron diffraction data. N<sub>Hg</sub>
      is the number of Hg atoms per 4 carbon atoms. Additional
      parameters for the hydrogenated sample: hydrogen position =
      3.9 &Aring;; hydrogen/carbon ratio = 1.0. The parameters
      reported for the hydrogenated sample are not well constrained
      since the residual in this case is considerably higher than
      for the other diffraction patterns.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For the hydrogenated sample, there were other free parameters
      besides those listed in the table. These were the hydrogen
      position, stoichiometry, and Debye-Waller factor. A ballpark
      starting value for the H Debye-Waller factor, 4.58
      &Aring;<sup>2</sup>, was estimated from the inelastic
      neutron-scattering data taken on C<sub>4</sub>KH<sub>x</sub>
      by Kamitakahara, Doll, and Eklund,[<a href=
      "node66.html#solin88">218</a>] using a procedure suggested by
      Kamitakahara.[<a href="node66.html#kamitakahara88">122</a>]
      (This procedure is briefly described in Appendix A.)
      Unfortunately, even with all these free parameters, attempts
      to fit these data with reasonable numbers produced
      unacceptably high residual values, on the order of 0.2. Here
      ``reasonable'' is defined very liberally to mean that the
      stoichiometries and atomic distances were all required to be
      positive. To obtain even R = 0.2, it was necessary to use a
      hydrogen stoichiometry of 1.0 and a hydrogen position of 3.9
      &Aring;, closer to the graphite plane than the potassium
      plane. Therefore, the values obtained from the fit to the
      hydrogen diffraction pattern are included only for
      completeness, and are not to be taken too seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The failure of the 6-layer model to fit the hydrogen data is
      not easily understood. It does not seem likely that hydrogen
      causes a drastic rearrangement of the atomic positions along
      the c-axis considering that I<sub>c</sub> is unchanged by
      hydrogenation within experimental error (see Figure 3.8). The
      best course would probably be to fit (00<i>l</i>) x-rays to
      determine the positions and stoichiometries of the
      non-hydrogen layers. These other layers' parameters could
      then be fixed in fitting the neutron diffraction pattern,
      where only the hydrogen parameters would be varied. The
      available x-ray diffractometer cannot provide enough
      (00<i>l</i>) x-ray peaks to determine all the K and Hg
      parameters, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was decided to synthesize hydrogenated single-crystal
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimens so that their entire (hkl)
      spectrum could be imaged in one scan with an x-ray precession
      camera.[<a href="node66.html#speck88z">222</a>] Then there
      would be enough peaks to determine at least the K and Hg
      stoichiometries, which could then be used as input to the
      fits for the hydrogenated samples. In the one attempt made at
      a precession camera study of an unhydrogenated
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg single crystal, promising results were
      obtained. This work was not completed due to time
      constraints, but it deserves a more sustained effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point it is most fruitful to return to a discussion
      of the lessons of Table <a href="node18.html#neutnum"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. The first major point
      is the good agreement between the parameters obtained for the
      pink C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimen and those found by Yang <em>et
      al.</em>[<a href="node66.html#yang84">272</a>] These samples
      appear to have been basically identical. The gold sample
      appears to have been slightly more mercury-rich than the pink
      specimen and Yang's majority phase. The parameters for the
      gold sample also indicate that its central mercury layer was
      slightly split, but that its potassium plane was closer to
      the center of the sandwich. Considering that the differences
      among the parameters of the various samples are small, and
      that each type of C<sub>4</sub>KHg has been measured only
      once, any conclusions drawn from the numbers in this table
      must be considered quite tentative.

      In order to get a better feel for the real-space structure
      implied by the numbers in the table, the structure factors
      can be Fourier-tranformed to yield some information about the
      nuclear positions. The analytic form of the Fourier transform
      is

      where <i>rho</i>(z) is the nuclear scattering intensity as a
      function of position along the c-axis.[<a href=
      "node66.html#yang84">272</a>] In order to do this
      calculation, one must find out the correct signs for the
      experimental structure factors from the calculated ones,
      since the ratios of the integrated intensities are
      necessarily positive. The density map that results from this
      construction is called a Patterson function.[<a href=
      "node66.html#speck88z">222</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleven peaks is rather few to perform such a transform since
      aliasing will occur on length scales of the order
      I<sub>c</sub>/11 0.9 &Aring;. Therefore, if a good fit to the
      data has been obtained, a reasonable procedure is to use
      calculated structure factors to extend the experimental
      structure factors up to higher <i>l</i>. This extension was
      performed up to <i>l</i> = 50 for the pink and gold samples.
      Extending the data of the hydrogenated sample seemed to be a
      questionable idea considering the poor quality of the fit.
      Patterson functions were also calculated by the authors of
      Ref. [<a href="node66.html#yang84">272</a>], so comparison
      with their transforms can also be made. Such comparisons are
      shown in Figure 3.10.

      majority phase of C<sub>4</sub>KHg along the c-axis as

      diffraction data. All plots were scaled to a carbon peak
      height of 1.0. a) Plot of nuclear scattering intensity versus
      distance along the graphite c-axis for a pink sample (*) and

    <p>
      While the Patterson plots shown in Figure 3.10 do not give
      any new information, they do serve to deliver the information
      in Table 3.3 in more easily digestible form. There do seem to
      be small differences between the pink and gold samples that
      are larger than the difference between the pink sample and
      Yang's parameters for the majority phase. Since these
      measurements have only been performed on a few specimens, it
      is necessary to be very cautious. The apparent shift in the
      potassium peak position between the pink specimen and Yang's
      specimen is meaningless because the potassium layer
      contributes so little to the overall scattering intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only distinction between the higher- T<sub>c</sub> pink
      GIC's and the lower- T<sub>c</sub> gold ones that can be made
      with confidence is that the gold samples are more likely to
      contain the minority <i>beta</i> phase. This assertion is
      well-founded because it corroborates an observation already
      made with (00<i>l</i>) x-rays. Because <i>beta</i>-phase
      peaks were observed with neutrons in a specimen which
      appeared single-phase from x-rays, it is tempting to conclude
      that all gold lower- T<sub>c</sub> C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples
      contain the <i>beta</i> phase. The paper of Yang and
      coauthors suggests some structural differences between the
      majority and minority phases. The possible consequences for
      superconductivity of the slightly higher I<sub>c</sub> and Hg
      content of the <i>beta</i> phase are discussed in Chapter 5.

      There are other ways to measure the stoichiometry of
      compounds that provide an important check on the parameters
      obtained from fits to diffraction data. Among these are
      Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), weight uptake
      measurements, and wet chemical analysis. The results of these
      experiments on GIC's are discussed in the next section.<br />
