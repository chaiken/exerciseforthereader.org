    <p>
      Sample preparation and characterization is quite an important
      topic for the ternary graphite-based superconductors. A
      thorough discussion of specimen synthesis and handling is
      obligatory not only because it is customary, but because the
      details of these techniques appear to impact the results of
      the experiments discussed in the following chapters in
      non-trivial ways. Reports in the literature on
      superconducting GIC's have often been confusing or even
      contradictory for reasons possibly related to differences
      between the samples prepared by the various research groups.
      Because of the inadequate information about sample
      preparation in many papers (as in, ``The samples were
      prepared using the technique of Ref. X ...''), one is often
      left wondering whether in-house experiments and those by
      other groups were performed on comparable materials. It is
      the aim of this chapter to give enough information about the
      samples used in the current experiments so that anyone who
      reproduces these efforts will not have to ask a similar
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leaders in the field of ternary GIC discovery and
      synthesis are the group at the University of Nancy. Under the
      leadership of Profs. H&eacute;rold and Lagrange, a team of
      students and staff has synthesized an impressive array of
      ternary GIC superconductors. The first reported were the
      MHg-GIC's, where M stands for one the heavy alkali metals.[<a
      href="node66.html#lagrange80">150</a>] Soon after the same
      authors described the preparation of the MTl-GIC's,[<a href=
      "node66.html#lagrange80">150</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#elmakrini80a">73</a>] and recently they
      announced the discovery of the large class of MBi-GIC's.[<a
      href="node66.html#lagrange85">146</a>] All of these materials
      have been reported to be superconducting. Lagrange[<a href=
      "node66.html#lagrange87">145</a>] has recently reviewed the
      lessons learned about the intercalation chemistry of this
      entire class of compounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noted that the Nancy group has also synthesized
      ternary GIC's whose superconductivity seems probable, but has
      not been experimentally verified. Besides the
      alkali-metal/heavy-metal ternaries mentioned above, whose
      intercalant sandwich consists of multiple metal layers, there
      are also ternaries with monolayer intercalant sandwiches.
      Among these candidates are solid solutions of known GIC
      superconductors, such
      C<sub>8</sub>K<sub>1-x</sub>Rb<sub>x</sub>,[<a href=
      "node66.html#billaud74">24</a>] and others such as
      sodium-barium GIC's[<a href=
      "node66.html#billaud74a">25</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#billaud78">26</a>] whose superconductivity seems
      quite likely in terms of existing models.[<a href=
      "node66.html#M143">4</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#fischer85">86</a>] These materials have received
      a lot of attention from a structural characterization
      standpoint,[<a href="node66.html#chow83">39</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#chow87a">40</a>] but few cryogenic transport
      studies have been performed on them. The reader will find
      more information on these compounds in a recent review by
      Solin and Zabel.[<a href="node66.html#solin88">218</a>] There
      is also a whole new class of alkali-metal/antimony compounds
      whose low-temperature[<a href=
      "node66.html#essaddek88">83</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#elmakrini88">71</a>] properties are unknown.
      Despite the fundamental interest in these materials, they
      will not be discussed further here, since determination of
      their superconductivity is left for future investigators.
    </p>
    <p>
      The superconductivity of the alkali-metal/heavy-metal ternary
      GIC's is the focus of the remainder of this work. Sample
      preparation issues are particularly important for
      superconductivity experiments because they presumably are the
      key to understanding why such a wide range of transition
      temperatures has been reported for some superconducting
      GIC's. For example, T<sub>c</sub> for C<sub>4</sub>KHg has
      been variously reported in the range from 0.7[<a href=
      "node66.html#iye82">120</a>] to 1.6 K,[<a href=
      "node66.html#N128">247</a>] while T<sub>c</sub> for
      C<sub>4</sub>CsBi<sub>0.5</sub> has been quoted from 4.05
      K[<a href="node66.html#lagrange85">146</a>] to &lt;=0.5 K.[<a
      href="node66.html#E291">36</a>] In the next few sections an
      attempt will be made to relate sample preparation conditions
      to reproducibility problems with superconductivity
      experiments in GIC's.<br />
