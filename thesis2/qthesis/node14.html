    <p>
      The basis for understanding the synthesis of a ternary
      graphite intercalation compound comes from an examination of
      the phase diagram of the relevant binary alloy. The phase
      diagrams of the K-Hg and Cs-Bi binary alloy systems are shown
      in Fig. 3.1. There are two reasons that the phase diagrams
      are important. One is that the phase diagram gives pertinent
      information about temperatures and alloy compositions
      necessary for preparation of a given GIC, as discussed below.
      For example, when a particular heavy element has only limited
      solubility for the alkali metals, as in the case of lead,[<a
      href="node66.html#hansen58">103</a>] then that heavy metal
      will be difficult, if not impossible, to intercalate in
      combination with an alloy. This is the case for lead, as has
      been shown by various unsucessful attempts at intercalation,
      both here at MIT and by Lagrange and coworkers.[<a href=
      "node66.html#lagrange85">146</a>] Also,since many of the
      properties of GIC's are similar to those of the
      intercalant,[<a href="node66.html#I94">67</a>] the phase
      diagram is a useful source of information about the GIC. For
      example, inelastic neutron scattering studies of the
      C<sub>8</sub>K<sub>1-x</sub>Rb<sub>x</sub> system have shown
      that the elastic constants of the intercalant layer are
      minimum at the same x where the eutectic point of the binary
      phase diagram occurs.[<a href=
      "node66.html#neumann84">183</a>]

      Cs-Bi binary alloys.[<a href=

    </p>
    <p>
      According to Lagrange[<a href=
      "node66.html#lagrange87">145</a>], the stage of a GIC is
      determined only by the stoichiometry of the starting alloy.
      This finding is illustrated by Figure 3.2, which shows that a
      given composition range for each of the K-Hg and Cs-Bi
      systems corresponds to a unique stage in the final sample.
      The current study confirms the idea that alloy composition is
      the primary determinant of stage in the ternary GIC's. Good
      agreement was also found between the composition ranges
      indicated on the phase diagrams for production of a given
      stage and the results reported here.

      There were three fundamentally different methods used to
      synthesize the specimens used in these studies. These are
      contact-intercalation, sequential vapor-phase intercalation,
      and single-step vapor-phase intercalation. In the
      contact-intercalation and single-step vapor-phase
      intercalation techniques, the starting alloy was reacted
      first in an evacuated pyrex tube, and then exposed to the
      graphite in a separate furnace session. An amount of alloy
      several times the quantity needed to complete the reaction
      stoichiometrically was always used. In the sequential
      intercalation method used for C<sub>8</sub>KHg,
      C<sub>8</sub>K was prepared by reaction of elemental
      potassium with graphite at 200&deg;C, and then a
      stoichiometric amount of mercury was reacted with the
      C<sub>8</sub>K at 290-300&deg;C. This temperature was chosen
      to be just above the liquidus line for the compound
      KHg<sub>2</sub> (see the K-Hg phase diagram), from which
      C<sub>8</sub>KHg also can be prepared. The
      sequential-intercalation method was first discovered by El
      Makrini and coworkers.[<a href=
      "node66.html#elmakrini80a">73</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal difficulty with the single-step vapor-phase
      intercalation technique was the inaccuracy of measurement of
      the alkali metal. The volume of the alkali metal was
      estimated by measuring the volume of its glass container,
      thereby assuming that the metal filled the container
      uniformly, without any cavities. A more accurate way of
      measuring the amount of alkali metal (and of measuring
      mercury) is to have a microbalance in the glovebox where the
      metals are handled. This technique was employed by the
      research group at the University of Kentucky.[<a href=
      "node66.html#doll86">63</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Contact intercalation, in which the graphite starting
      material is actually in contact with the liquid intercalant
      inside an evacuated pyrex ampoule, was used in the synthesis
      of all CsBi-GIC's. The starting alloy used in these reactions
      was Cs<sub>5</sub>Bi<sub>4</sub>, and the temperature of the
      intercalation was about 480&deg;C to 500&deg;C, just above
      the liquidus line for the alloy (see the phase diagram). If
      the liquid metal were not placed in contact with the
      graphite, then even if all other conditions were right, the
      final product was always C<sub>8</sub>Cs.[<a href=
      "node66.html#E291">36</a>] This reaction was almost
      foolproof: every single attempt at making the CsBi-GIC's with
      the contact method resulted in the intercalation of
      single-stage CsBi-GIC. C<sub>4</sub>CsBi<sub>0.5</sub>
      <i>alpha</i>-phase samples were violet, and
      C<sub>4</sub>CsBi<sub>1.0</sub> <i>beta</i>-phase samples
      were blue-green, as previously reported. Thus it appeared
      that the CsBi-GIC's are less sensitive to the details of
      preparation than the KHg-GIC's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulty with the contact reaction was that the GIC's
      were often embedded in the hard alloy metal when the
      intercalation ampoule was removed from the furnace. Removing
      the samples from the alloy without fracturing them was often
      a tricky business. An attempt was made to remove the liquid
      alloy from the sample surface by tilting the entire furnace a
      few hours before the intercalation ampoule was to be removed,
      but these attempts were unsuccessful. The other problem with
      the CsBi intercalation, which probably is related to the
      contact reaction, is that macroscopic inclusions of the
      starting alloy were often found inside the samples. This is
      discussed further below, and also in Section 6.2.
    </p>
    <p>
      The single-step vapor-phase two-zone technique can be used to
      synthesize both C<sub>4</sub>KHg and C<sub>8</sub>KHg, as
      originally reported of El Makrini <em>et al.</em> [<a href=
      "node66.html#elmakrini80a">73</a>] The modifier ``two-zone''
      here refers to the fact that the graphite may be kept at a
      slightly higher temperature (T <sub>prep</sub> +
      <i>Delta</i>T) than the alloy ( T<sub>prep</sub>) in order to
      prevent condensation of metal on the GIC surface.[<a href=
      "node66.html#I94">67</a>] In the C<sub>8</sub>KHg case,
      KHg<sub>2</sub> alloy was placed inside an evacuated ampoule
      with graphite and the two were reacted isothermally at
      290&deg;-300&deg;C for three weeks. The KHg<sub>2</sub> alloy
      was silver in color, and the stage II GIC was always blue,
      both as previously reported.[<a href=
      "node66.html#J140">248</a>] In the C<sub>4</sub>KHg case, the
      starting alloys ranged in composition from
      K<sub>2</sub>Hg<sub>3</sub> to K<sub>5</sub>Hg<sub>4</sub>.
      The reaction was carried out at temperatures between
      200&deg;C and 260&deg;C for a period of two weeks. These
      alloys were gold in color, and the intercalation compounds
      ranged in tint from gold to copper to pink. No systematic
      effects were seen as a function of the starting alloy
      composition in C<sub>4</sub>KHg. Most reactions were carried
      out with the alloy KHg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temperature differences <i>Delta</i>T between the graphite
      and the alloy for C<sub>4</sub>KHg were varied between 0&deg;
      and 10&deg;, as opposed to the case for C<sub>8</sub>KHg,
      where only isothermal conditions were employed. In the case
      of isothermal reactions, the intercalation ampoule was
      wrapped in several thick layers of aluminum foil in order to
      guard against unintended temperature gradients in the
      furnace. If the intercalation ampoule was kept short, and a
      large furnace was used, it is estimated that the temperature
      at the two ends of the ampoule could be kept the same to
      within a degree or two. Through use of an ice-point reference
      on the furnace's temperature controller and liberally applied
      glass wool insulation, the temperature of the intercalation
      ampoule could be controlled to within about &plusmn;10&deg;C
      during the reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outcome of the C<sub>4</sub>KHg reaction is quite
      sensitive to the temperature of the furnace. On more than one
      occasion, a tube containing KHg alloy plus graphite which had
      mysteriously not reacted at all was removed from the furnace.
      Half the time the intercalation could be accomplished simply
      by cooking the tube for another couple of weeks, under
      apparently identical conditions. The trickiness of the
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg intercalation has been noted before by
      Timp.[<a href="node66.html#J140">248</a>] It is not
      surprising that the C<sub>4</sub>KHg intercalation is more
      difficult than that of a compound with a simpler structure,
      like C<sub>8</sub>K, but it is somewhat unexpected that the
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg preparation is much more difficult to
      control than that of C<sub>8</sub>KHg. Samples from two
      C<sub>8</sub>KHg batches are almost indistiguishable from one
      another, even if one is made through sequential
      intercalation, and the other made using a single-step
      vapor-phase reaction. The predictability of the
      C<sub>8</sub>KHg reaction is underlined by the
      reproducibility of its superconducting transition
      temperature, as measured by several research groups. These
      T<sub>c</sub> values are gathered in Table 3.1. In contrast,
      the T<sub>c</sub> values reported for C<sub>4</sub>KHg and
      shown in Table 3.2 exhibit a great deal of scatter.

       <strong>Table 3.1:</strong> T<sub>c</sub> values for
      C<sub>8</sub>KHg as reported by several research groups.
      There is almost universal agreement on T<sub>c</sub> 1.9
      K.<br />

       <strong>Table 3.2:</strong> T<sub>c</sub> values for
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg as reported by several research groups.
      There is a great deal of scatter in the values, which seem to
      fall primarily into two groups, with most likely values being
      about 0.8 and 1.5 K. <i>dagger</i> indicates a broad
      superconducting transition. <i>ddagger</i> indicates a
      liquid-nitrogen quenched sample.[<a href=
      "node66.html#delong82a">58</a>]<br />
       Why should the results of the stage II intercalation be so
      much more reproducible than those of the stage I? The answer
      seems to lie in the multiphase behavior of C<sub>4</sub>KHg,
      as opposed to the single-phase behavior of C<sub>8</sub>KHg.
      C<sub>8</sub>KHg has only one common in-plane ordering, the
      (2&times;2)R0&deg; in-plane superlattice which has been
      observed in neutron diffraction.[<a href=
      "node66.html#kamitakahara84b">124</a>] This ordering is
      associated with an I<sub>c</sub> = 13.56 &Aring;, the only
      repeat distance observed in C<sub>4</sub>KHg.[<a href=
      "node66.html#kamitakahara84b">124</a>] C<sub>4</sub>KHg, on
      the other hand, has two commonly observed phases. These are
      the <i>alpha</i> phase, which has a (2&times;2)R0&deg;
      in-plane ordering and I<sub>c</sub> = 10.24 &Aring;, and the
      <i>beta</i> phase, which has a
      (<i>sqrt</i>3&times;2)R(30&deg;, 0&deg;) in-plane ordering
      and I<sub>c</sub> = 10.83 &Aring;.[<a href=
      "node66.html#J140">248</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#kamitakahara84">123</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#K167">246</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      More details about the microstructure of the specimens used
      for the superconductivity studies are given below. The main
      point to be taken away from the discussion here is that the
      synthesis of C<sub>4</sub>KHg is very sensitive to the exact
      conditions used because different conditions will produce a
      given combination of phases, as previously noted by Timp.[<a
      href="node66.html#J140">248</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after several years of study of the question of the
      connection between preparation conditions and the various
      phases, there are still many uncertainties. As an example,
      notice in Table 3.2 that the T<sub>c</sub> = 0.719 K and
      0.822 K gold samples were produced with nominally the same
      conditions that usually give pink T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K
      GIC's. Also, the T<sub>c</sub> = 1.472 K and 1.317 K
      specimens came from the same intercalation ampoule.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few general statements about the synthesis of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg may be made, despite some uncertainties.
      Intercalation at temperatures significantly higher than
      200&deg;C produces samples with broad superconducting
      transitions that are more or less copper in color. The
      intercalation temperature of 350&deg;C used by Yang <em>et
      al.</em>[<a href="node66.html#yang88">270</a>] would be
      expected to result in specimens with quite broad
      superconducting transitions. Intentional use of a temperature
      difference (<i>Delta</i>T) on the order of 10&deg;C does
      consistently produce gold, low- T<sub>c</sub> specimens, as
      originally noted by Timp and coworkers.[<a href=
      "node66.html#J140">248</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#timp83">249</a>] Kim and coworkers also observed
      that use of a temperature difference during intercalation
      increases the final amount of the I<sub>c</sub> = 10.83
      &Aring; <i>beta</i> phase.[<a href=
      "node66.html#kim84">130</a>] The recent experiments seemed to
      show that temperature differences on the order of 5&deg;C
      were sufficient to produce degradation in the superconducting
      properties, in contrast to Timp's claim that small
      temperature differences enhance superconductivity.[<a href=
      "node66.html#J140">248</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The snag in this neat explanation is that gold samples were
      sometimes produced using an isothermal reaction. Whether this
      was due to poor control of the temperature difference between
      the alloy and graphite is not known. In addition, attempts to
      produce gold GIC's with T<sub>c</sub> 0.7K sometimes resulted
      in copper-colored samples with broad transitions. It seems
      likely that other poorly controlled factors were also playing
      a role.
    </p>
    <p>
      One possible factor is the overall time allowed for the
      reaction. In the current work, and also that of Timp,[<a
      href="node66.html#timp83">249</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#J140">248</a>] the intercalation was allowed to
      proceed for two weeks or longer, whereas Iye and
      collaborators[<a href="node66.html#iye82">120</a>] only
      allowed intercalation to occur for ``several days''. Yang and
      coworkers also allowed only ``several days'' for their
      reactions.[<a href="node66.html#yang88">270</a>] The Univ. of
      Nancy group does not specifically state how long they allowed
      for intercalation of their samples (which were used in the
      specific heat studies of Alexander <em>et. al</em>[<a href=
      "node66.html#alexander81">8</a>]). The reaction time could be
      an important variable if, for example, the higher-
      T<sub>c</sub> phase is the equilibrium state of the system,
      but its formation is slower than that of the lower-
      T<sub>c</sub> phase. If this were the case, leaving the
      ampoule in the furnace longer might result in a higher-
      T<sub>c</sub>. Bendriss-Rerhrhaye of the University of Nancy
      notes that in the CsBi-GIC's the pure <i>beta</i> phase is
      produced if the reaction is allowed to proceed for two weeks,
      but that a mixture of <i>alpha</i> and <i>beta</i> is found
      after only one week.[<a href=
      "node66.html#bendriss86">17</a>]In this interpretation, if
      for some reason a particular batch of graphite was harder to
      intercalate, KHg intercalation compounds formed from it might
      still be in the gold, lower- T<sub>c</sub> phase after the
      usual reaction period, even with <i>Delta</i>T = 0.
      Alternatively, a particular intercalation might take longer
      if the KHg alloy used had been contaminated by air and had a
      refractory oxide coating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another factor in the intercalation of C<sub>4</sub>KHg which
      has received little attention in the literature is how the
      intercalation ampoule was transferred into and out of the
      furnace. In the experiments reported here, the furnace was
      always cooled down to about 70&deg;C before the ampoules were
      removed. Sometimes, though, the furnaces were cooled down
      overnight. At the University of Kentucky, it was customary to
      remove ampoules while they were still hot.[<a href=
      "node66.html#doll86">63</a>] Sometimes the ampoules were even
      quenched in liquid nitrogen when they were removed from the
      oven.[<a href="node66.html#delong82a">58</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#heinz83">107</a>] It is not known what practice
      the Japanese,[<a href="node66.html#iye82">120</a>] French,[<a
      href="node66.html#elmakrini80a">73</a>] and previous MIT[<a
      href="node66.html#timp83">249</a>] investigators followed in
      this regard. If the low- T<sub>c</sub> phase is the
      equilibrium phase at higher temperatures, and the higher-
      T<sub>c</sub> phase is the equilibrium phase at room
      temperature, then removing the intercalation ampoule from the
      furnace while hot might quench in the high-temperature, low-
      T<sub>c</sub> phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only recently did the MIT investigators become aware of
      different practices at different institutions regarding the
      removal of the intercalation ampoule from the furnace.
      Unfortunately, little attention was paid to this point during
      the years of sample synthesis recorded by Table 3.2. Recently
      it was decided to study the effect of removing the
      intercalation ampoules from the furnace hot, but the result
      was sample exfoliation in each of about 5 batches of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg thus prepared. It is not understood why this
      exfoliation occurred, since it was not a common consequence
      of hot sample extraction at the Univ. of Kentucky.[<a href=
      "node66.html#doll86">63</a>] At any rate, the results of this
      study were inconclusive.

      Annealing studies of C<sub>4</sub>KHg seem merited in light
      of the possibility that the higher- T<sub>c</sub> GIC's are
      an equilibrium phase, and the lower- T<sub>c</sub> ones are
      metastable. Particularly if the intercalation reaction has
      been hindered by slow kinetics, it seems that putting a gold
      low- T<sub>c</sub> sample back into the furnace might improve
      its superconducting properties. However, as reported by
      Lagrange <em>et al.</em>, the thermal stability of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg is very low, even in the presence of excess
      amalgam, so that attempts at annealing usually result in
      deintercalation.[<a href="node66.html#lagrange80a">148</a>]
      The difficulty of thermally annealling C<sub>4</sub>KHg is
      not surprising in light of the exfoliation problems reported
      above.

      A third factor in sample preparation which might well be
      thought to influence T<sub>c</sub> is the quality of the
      graphite host material. In the stage I binary compound
      C<sub>8</sub>K, T<sub>c</sub> was found to be strongly
      correlated with the type of graphite used. That is, a
      T<sub>c</sub> of 0.15 K appears to be average for HOPG host
      material,[<a href="node66.html#koike80">141</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#kobayashi81">136</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#kaneiwa82">125</a>] but T<sub>c</sub> = 0.13 is
      the highest T<sub>c</sub> observed for Grafoil-based
      samples,[<a href="node66.html#kobayashi79">135</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#kobayashi81a">137</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#sano80">214</a>] and 0.08 K was reported to
      C<sub>8</sub>K powder.[<a href="node66.html#koike80">141</a>]
      In the current series of experiments, no such correlation
      between graphite type and T<sub>c</sub> was found; kish,
      HOPG, and Madagascar graphite flakes could all be transformed
      into gold or pink samples, depending on the intercalation
      conditions used. Defects in the graphite could be responsible
      for slight variations in T<sub>c</sub> in C<sub>4</sub>KHg,
      say between 1.5 and 1.55 K. This would imply that the
      absolute size of the effect of the graphite host on
      T<sub>c</sub> (about 50 mK) is constant between
      C<sub>8</sub>K and C<sub>4</sub>KHg, rather than the
      percentage change in T<sub>c</sub> being constant (50 mK is
      about 30% of T<sub>c</sub> for C<sub>8</sub>K, but only about
      3% of T<sub>c</sub> of C<sub>4</sub>KHg). Certainly the
      impact of the starting graphite is not as great for
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg or C<sub>8</sub>KHg as for C<sub>8</sub>K.

      The primary conclusion from the study of the synthesis of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg is that higher intercalation temperatures
      tend to lead to lower T<sub>c</sub>'s. Elevating the graphite
      temperature above 200&deg;C seems to suppress T<sub>c</sub>,
      whether the alloy temperature is also raised or not. However,
      raising the temperature of both the alloy and the graphite
      tends to give copper-colored samples with broad
      superconducting transitions and T<sub>c</sub> 1.0 K, while
      raising only the alloy temperature tends to give gold samples
      with narrower transitions and T<sub>c</sub> 0.8 K. These
      conclusions are in general agreement with those of Timp and
      colleagues.[<a href="node66.html#J140">248</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#timp83">249</a>] However, the synthesis of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg is still not entirely understood, since the
      results of intercalation are not altogether predictable. This
      is believed to be due to the importance of factors whose
      importance is difficult to evaluate. Among the possibilities
      are the duration of the intercalation reaction, hot
      intercalation ampoule extraction, and alloy cleanliness.

      Reproducibility problems with the T<sub>c</sub> of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg are undoubtedly due to the several in-plane
      phases it can contain. The wide variation found for
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg contrasts with the ease of reproducing
      results for C<sub>8</sub>KHg, which has only one in-plane
      phase. One naturally wonders whether the difficulty of
      reproducing superconductivity in the CsBi-GIC's is also tied
      in with the question of multiple phases. This question is
      discussed further in Section 6.2. The section that follows,
      Section 3.3, treats the normal-state characterization of the
      GIC's used in the superconductivity experiments. The
      relationship between the in-plane phases and
      superconductivity is the topic of Chapter 5.<br />
