      The most obvious conclusion to be extracted from the numbers
      in Table <a href="node57.html#electronicparams"><img width=
      "13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> is that the bismuth in
      the CsBi-GIC's is acting as an acceptor of electrons, similar
      to behavior of the heavy metal in other trilayer ternary
      GIC's. This conclusion is drawn due to the lower
      E<sub>F</sub> and f<sub>C</sub> of the bismuth GIC's compared
      to the binary Cs-GIC's, and also due to the fairly high
      E<sub>2g2</sub> Raman frequencies displayed by the
      CsBi-GIC's.[<a href="node66.html#yang88">270</a>] According
      to Refs. [<a href="node66.html#chan87">37</a>] and [<a href=
      "node66.html#pietronero78">194</a>], a higher Raman frequency
      for donor compounds is indicative of a smaller in-plane
      carbon-carbon distance and thereby a smaller f<sub>C</sub>.
      Therefore, all evidence points to less cesium charge per
      carbon atom being resident in the graphite layers than in
      C<sub>8</sub>Cs and possibly even C<sub>24</sub>Cs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture then is of positively charged cesium layers and
      negatively charged bismuth and carbon layers. Since it is
      generally accepted that the superconducting MHg-GIC's and
      MTl-GIC's also have layers of alternating charge[<a href=
      "node66.html#herold81">110</a>], this insight would appear to
      be of little help in understanding the apparent lack of
      superconductivity in the CsBi-GIC's. It is hard to see why
      back transfer of charge from the carbon layers would reduce
      T<sub>c</sub> in the MBi compounds when it seems to raise
      T<sub>c</sub> in the MTl- and MHg-GIC's.
    </p>
    <p>
      A closer look at Table <a href=
      "node57.html#electronicparams"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> shows that, roughly speaking, GIC's with | f<sub>C</sub>
      | less than about 0.042 (= 1/24) are not found to be
      superconducting. An accumulation of experimental evidence[<a
      href="node66.html#fretigny85">89</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#doll87">62</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#I63">66</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#preil84">199</a>] supports the conclusion that
      in the stage 2 alkali metal GIC's that the alkali metal is
      fully ionized, and in fact it seems reasonable to suppose
      that in any ternary compound where | f<sub>C</sub> |
      ;SPM<sub>l</sub>t; 0.04 the alkali metal atom will be fully
      ionized. The thinking behind this is that the graphitic
      <i>pi</i> bands have such a high affinity for the
      alkali-metal s-electron that the only reason that
      f<sub>C</sub> can fall very low is for the heavy metal
      acceptor to outcompete the <i>pi</i>-band for the s-charge.
      Therefore a low f<sub>C</sub> in a ternary compound implies
      that f<sub>M</sub> = +1. The data accumulated in Table <a
      href="node57.html#electronicparams"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> therefore suggests that
      superconductivity in ternary GIC's is suppressed by an empty
      s band, a conclusion in keeping with the Al Jishi model[<a
      href="node66.html#M143">4</a>] of superconductivity in binary
      graphite intercalation compounds. This model suggests that
      s-band occupancy is necessary for superconductivity in GIC's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next natural question to arise is that of why physically
      the s-band occupation should be imperative for
      superconductivity. More intuition on this question can be
      developed by examining quantities closely linked to s-band
      occupancy, namely the c-axis resistivity and the resistivity
      anisotropy. Table <a href="node58.html#resistanis"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>, taken directly from the
      work of McRae and Mar&ecirc;ch&eacute;[<a href=
      "node66.html#mcrae88">166</a>], shows that the compounds
      identified above as having an empty s-band also have a high
      <i>rho</i><sub>c</sub> and a high resistivity anisotropy ==
      <i>rho</i><sub>c</sub>/<i>rho</i><sub>a</sub>. High values
      for the anisotropy and <i>rho</i><sub>c</sub> indicate an
      almost two-dimensional band structure, often with hopping
      conduction along ^c.[<a href="node66.html#R200">227</a>,<a
      href="node66.html#E343">229</a>]
    </p>

       <strong>Table:</strong> Two tables prepared by McRae and
      Mar&ecirc;ch&eacute;[<a href="node66.html#mcrae88">166</a>]
      which list the c-axis resistivity and resistivity anisotropy
      of many GIC's, both donors and acceptors. A==
      <i>rho</i><sub>c</sub>/rho<sub>a</sub>. Correct sources for
      these numbers are given in Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#mcrae88">166</a>].<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The chain of reasoning developed in this section seems to
      imply that two-dimensionality of band structure tends to
      suppress superconductivity in GIC's. This is a conclusion
      which has been previously reached by leading
      superconductivity experts[<a href=
      "node66.html#matthias71">163</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#hannay65">102</a>] when they turned their
      attention to the problem of superconductivity in GIC's. The
      reasons why two-dimensional superconductivity might be
      expected in the closely related transition metal
      dichalcogenides intercalation compounds and not in the GIC's
      is discussed in Section <a href="#tmdc"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
    </p>
    <p>
      The apparent lack of superconductivity in the MBi-GIC's is a
      great disappointment. Many experimentalists wanted to take
      advantage of the new materials' increased air stability and
      reported higher T<sub>c</sub>'s to extend the scope of
      experiments that could reasonably be performed on
      superconducting GIC's. Despite the letdown, attempts to
      answer the question of why the MBi-GIC's are not
      superconducting have led to some insight about the properties
      of the MHg-GIC's, which are the topic of the rest of this
      thesis. Finally, it should be mentioned that the
      irreproducibility of transition temperatures in other
      intercalation compounds leaves one with the hope that
      superconductivity may yet be confirmed in the MBi-GIC's.
