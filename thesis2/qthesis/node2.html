    <p>
      Many people collaborated on the research described in this
      thesis. In particular I would like to thank Jagadeesh
      Moodera, Eric Tkaczyk, Paul Tedrow, and Mike Blaho of the
      Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory for many hours of
      assistance with the low-temperature experiments. Special
      thanks go to Mike Blaho for straightening the (ahem) bent
      <sup>3</sup>He refrigerator. The high-field experiments could
      not have been performed without the assistance of Nai-chang
      Yeh and Bruce Brandt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neutron diffraction experiments were performed at the
      National Bureau of Standards reactor in collaboration with
      Dan Neumann, Bill Kamitakahara, and Ann Bouchard. The advice
      of Dan and Bill regarding the data analysis was invaluable.
      Nagel Stone machined the neutron sample cells, and also
      provided a lot of useful advice over the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerhard Roth and Mar&iacute;a Kudisch assisted with sample
      preparation and x-ray characterization in the early part of
      the KHg-GIC study. Dr. Toshiaki Enoki of the Tokyo Institute
      of Technology participated in the early hydrogenation
      experiments. Many of the ideas concerning the hydrogenation
      experiments come either from his advice or his publications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the students in the MGM research group, I would especially
      like to thank Jim Speck for answering so many elementary
      materials science questions about metallurgy and structural
      analysis. Thanks also go to James Nicholls for assistance in
      performing resistivity measurements, and Gary Doll and Yachin
      Liu for taking the Raman data. Gary greatly improved our
      methods of GIC synthesis when he arrived, so all the work on
      the KHg-GIC's has benefitted from his expertise. He also
      built the hydrogen train which was used in the later stages
      of the hydrogenation experiments. Special thanks go to James,
      Gary, and Jim for timely loans of equipment, some of which
      was even borrowed with their consent.

      This thesis could not have been written without Gene
      Dresselhaus, Lt. John Steinbeck, Eliot Dresselhaus, and Paul
      Dresselhaus, who kept the VAX running most of the time. Eliot
      supplied the text processing and graphics software with which
      this document and its figures were produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of all I would like to thank Wolfgang S. Rupprecht, partly
      for tangible favors like explaining electronics, debugging my
      computer programs, and making lots of tea. I would especially
      like to thank Wolfgang for encouragement when I most needed
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the teachers
      who made my experience in graduate school worthwhile. Frank
      Payne has always been very generous with his time, and he
      puts a lot more effort than necessary into teaching students
      about machining. Terry Orlando and Paul Tedrow provided a
      great deal of expert advice about the theory of
      superconductivity and data analysis. Professors Joannopolous,
      Jaffe, Tinkham and Jackiw taught courses which were not only
      valuable but inspirational. I also learned a great deal from
      the many courses taught by my thesis supervisor, Mildred
      Dresselhaus. I would like to express my gratitude to Millie
      and to Gene Dresselhaus for their knowledge, expertise and
      guidance.
