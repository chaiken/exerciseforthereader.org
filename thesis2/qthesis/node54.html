      The unanticipated outcome of the T<sub>c</sub> measurements
      was that no superconductivity could be detected in either
      <i>alpha</i>-phase or mixed <i>alpha</i> + <i>beta</i>-phase
      samples.[<a href="node66.html#E291">36</a>] By using Equation
      <a href="node26.html#vbridge"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> , it was determined that the superconducting effective
      area that would give a signal-to-noise ratio of one
      corresponded to about 2% of the area of the CsBi
      polycrystals. Therefore, from the inductive measurements it
      can be said with some confidence that no more than 2% of
      these samples is superconducting within the temperature range
      from 4.2 to 0.5 K.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temperature region above liquid helium temperature was
      only searched briefly for a transition at a T<sub>c</sub>
      higher than that reported by Lagrange <em>et al.</em> It is
      safe to conclude that a higher-temperature transition is not
      present, though, since an applied magnetic field of 23 Tesla
      did not produce any kind of superconducting transition. (The
      highest critical field known is well under 1 T.[<a href=
      "node66.html#iye82">120</a>])
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the null result from the inductive
      measurements, no interesting features in the resistivity were
      detected at low temperature. The compounds appeared to
      exhibit typical metallic behavior ( d<i>rho</i>/dT
      ;SPM<sub>g</sub>t; 0). The measured resistivity at 4.2 K was
      (8 &plusmn; 2) <i>mu</i><i>Omega</i>-cm in one stage 1
      <i>alpha</i>-phase sample, and (30 &plusmn; 7)
      <i>mu</i><i>Omega</i>-cm in a stage 1u <i>alpha</i> +
      <i>beta</i> sample. These values are somewhat higher than the
      5 K resistivity values quoted by Lagrange <em>et al.</em>,
      who measured their resisitivity values inductively.[<a href=
      "node66.html#mcrae85">168</a>] An applied magnetic field
      produced only traces consistent with magnetoresistive
      behavior, nothing like a superconducting-normal transition.
      [See discussion below.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The MIT superconductivity measurements are obviously in
      conflict with those described previously[<a href=
      "node66.html#lagrange85">146</a>], as are those of several
      other groups who also failed to find superconductivity.[<a
      href="node66.html#yang88">270</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#stang88">223</a>] In the most extensive set of
      measurements to date, Stang and coworkers in Berlin failed to
      find superconductivity in stage 1 <i>alpha</i>-phase
      CsBi-GIC's down to 50 mK even though they had sensitivity to
      a transition in about 0.1% of the sample volume.[<a href=
      "node66.html#stang88">223</a>] Even the Nancy group has had
      difficulty in reproducing the T<sub>c</sub> values they
      reported.[<a href="node66.html#lagrange85a">144</a>] A
      summary of all T<sub>c</sub> measurements on the MBi-GIC's to
      date is reported in Table <a href="node54.html#mbitc"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=

      The irreproducibility of the T<sub>c</sub> measurements in
      the CsBi-GIC's would be more surprising were it not for the
      wide range of transition temperatures found for other
      superconducting GIC's.[<a href="node66.html#ericescy">64</a>]
      In C<sub>4</sub>KHg, as was discussed previously, fairly
      subtle variations in intercalation conditions have a large
      effect on superconductivity. The wide range of T<sub>c</sub>
      values reported for C<sub>4</sub>KHg is thought to be due to
      the presence of the <i>beta</i> phase [see Section <a href=
      "node41.html#hydintro"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ]
      in low- T<sub>c</sub> samples. One possible explanation for
      the lack of superconductivity in the non-superconducting
      CsBi-GIC's is therefore that they possess minority phases
      which suppress superconductivity. Alternatively, as Lagrange
      has suggested,[<a href="node66.html#lagrange87">145</a>] it
      seems plausible that the differences found in the
      superconducting behavior in the CsBi experiments could be
      attributable to small differences in in-plane ordering or in
      stoichiometry. This type of sensitivity to ordering and/or
      stoichiometry has also been considered as an explanation for
      the wide range of T<sub>c</sub> values reported for
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg.[<a href="node66.html#Z234">206</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, there is another simple line of reasoning
      which explains the discrepancy among the various sets of
      experiments. The alternative explanation, also discussed by
      Stang and coworkers,[<a href="node66.html#stang88">223</a>]
      is that the superconducting transitions reported by Lagrange
      <em>et al.</em> were actually transitions of inclusions of
      the alloy CsBi<sub>2</sub>. This possibility is suggested by
      the presence of inclusions in the CsBi-GIC's which could not
      be completely removed by repeated cleaving. The inclusions
      were imaged during TEM studies which showed that they
      appeared throughout the samples prepared both here at MIT and
      at the University of Kentucky.[<a href=
      "node66.html#speck88z">222</a>] An electron micrograph of an
      inclusion is shown in Figure <a href=
      "node54.html#inclusion"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
    </p>

      <a id="3861" name="3861">&nbsp;</a><a id="inclusion" name=

       <strong>Figure:</strong> An electron micrograph showing
      intercalant inclusions (bright regions) in a

      magnification for this micrograph is indicated by the 100 nm
      scale bar. [Micrograph prepared by J. Speck, MIT.]<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of the MIT samples, the inclusions presumably had
      the approximate composition of the starting alloy,
      Cs<sub>5</sub>Bi<sub>4</sub>, a composition which is not
      superconducting. As would be expected, therefore, no
      inclusion-derived superconducting signal was seen in the MIT
      CsBi-GIC's. However, as shown by the phase diagram in Figure
      <a href="node14.html#phasediag"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> , Cs<sub>5</sub>Bi<sub>4</sub> is adjacent to
      CsBi<sub>2</sub>, a phase which is superconducting. The
      implication is that a starting alloy with a composition
      between Cs<sub>5</sub>Bi<sub>4</sub> and CsBi<sub>2</sub>
      (such as CsBi) should be a mixture of superconducting and
      non-superconducting material. One would therefore expect that
      a GIC made from such a starting alloy would have some
      superconducting inclusions. Inclusion-derived
      superconductivity was apparently seen by Stang <em>et
      al.</em>.[<a href="node66.html#stang88">223</a>] They
      observed that superconductivity was present only in small
      volume fractions in the CsBi-GIC's, consistent with
      inclusion-derived transitions. Further, Stang and coworkers
      found that T<sub>c</sub> was about 4.7 K almost independent
      of stage and phase. [See Table <a href=
      "node54.html#mbitc"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      .] The only processing variable which seemed to impact
      T<sub>c</sub> was the starting alloy composition, which
      presumably determines what fraction of the inclusions are
      superconducting. A plot of T<sub>c</sub> versus starting
      alloy composition is displayed in Figure <a href=
      "node54.html#csbialloytc"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .

      data from the CRC Handbook. The presence of <i>downarrow</i>
      means that the nearest point represents an upper bound on
      T<sub>c</sub>. Data from the University of Nancy is not
      included because precise starting alloy compositions are not
      given for their samples.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The implication of the MIT and Berlin work[<a href=
      "node66.html#stang88">223</a>] is that superconductivity in
      contact-intercalated GIC's can be mimicked by inclusions of a
      superconducting intercalant phase. In this interpretation,
      the superconductivity observed by Lagrange and colleagues in
      resistivity measurements was due to a network of
      CsBi<sub>2</sub> through the sample, either adsorbed on the
      surface or interconnected through the bulk. (Bulk
      interconnections could perhaps be provided by Daumas-Herold
      domains.) This superconducting alloy would completely short
      out any normal-state transport due to the GIC itself. In this
      interpretation, the University of Nancy low-temperature
      resistivity measurements do not measure a property intrinsic
      to the GIC, but to the adsorbed alloy. Then the reason that
      the MIT measurements give a higher value of
      <i>rho</i><sub>a</sub> at 4.2 K than the Nancy measurements
      is that the MIT measurements give <i>rho</i><sub>a, GIC</sub>
      while the Nancy ones give <i>rho</i><sub>a, alloy</sub>.
      Interpretation of these results would be more certain if it
      were known exactly what starting alloy compositions the
      French used and whether they cleaved their samples before
      performing the transport measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, one cannot make a firm statement as to whether
      the CsBi-GIC's are superconducting or not. Circumstantial
      evidence strongly indicates that the answer is no, but
      considering the long history of variability in the
      T<sub>c</sub>'s of GIC's, it is wise to be cautious. After
      the discovery of superconductivity in C<sub>8</sub>K at 0.55
      K in 1965, a transition was not observed again until 1978 at
      a much lower temperature of 0.139 K,[<a href=
      "node66.html#koike78">140</a>] with several unsuccessful
      attempts to reproduce the original experiment in intervening
      years.[<a href="node66.html#poitrenaud70">196</a>]
      Considering that it is not possible to tell whether the
      non-superconducting samples made outside Nancy are similar in
      every detail to those the superconductors synthesized there,
      an authoritative statement ruling out superconductivity in
      MBi-GIC's cannot be made. This is especially true for the
      KBi-and RbBi-GIC's, which have not yet been intensively
      studied outside Nancy. The best one can do at this time is
      say that available evidence does not support the
      identification of the MBi-GIC's as superconductors. A
      possible explanation why these compounds are not
      superconducting is discussed in Section <a href=
