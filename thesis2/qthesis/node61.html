    <p>
      One of the recurring themes in the GIC superconductivity
      literature has been the question of whether the graphite or
      alkali metal layers are superconducting in C<sub>8</sub>K.[<a
      href="node66.html#iye82">120</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#takada82">234</a>] The origin of the notion that
      <em>either</em> the graphitic or alkali electrons must be
      responsible for the superconductivity is a bit hard to
      fathom. After all, no one ever discusses the
      superconductivity of the transition metal layers of the
      transition metal dichalcogenides. The case that both
      graphitic and intercalant electrons contribute to GIC
      superconductivity[<a href="node66.html#M143">4</a>] would
      seem to be even clearer than the equivalent TMDC question
      since neither the alkali metal nor the graphite is separately
      superconducting. In the MHg-GIC's, the starting alloys are
      superconducting by themselves. However, the potassium and
      mercury planes cannot be solely responsible for the
      superconductivity of the compound, since otherwise
      T<sub>c</sub> would be expected to decline monotonically with
      increasing stage. In fact, as discussed in Section <a href=
      "node35.html#models"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>,
      T<sub>c</sub> of the KHg-GIC's has the opposite trend from
      that predicted by the proximity effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequent reference has been made to the properties of the
      superconducting transition metal dichalcogenides in this
      work, especially to NbSe<sub>2</sub>. In Chapter <a href=
      "node7.html#othersys"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      a progression in increasing anisotropy was proposed that
      began with bulk Nb, followed by NbSe<sub>2</sub>,
      alkali-intercalated NbSe<sub>2</sub>, and ended by
      organic-molecule intercalated TMDC's. When this project first
      began, there was a natural tendency to compare the
      alkali-intercalated GIC's with the alkali-intercalated TMDC's
      and the acceptor GIC's with the organic-intercalated GIC's.
      This comparison is a bit misleading, though. The point that
      has been overlooked in this juxataposition is the rather
      obvious fact that NbSe<sub>2</sub> is already
      superconducting. Because the properties of the TMDC's are not
      strongly modified by alkali intercalation,[<a href=
      "node66.html#woollam76">266</a>] in that case it is perhaps
      appropriate to speak of the superconductivity of the
      NbSe<sub>2</sub> sandwiches.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the superconducting sandwich in the case of the
      GIC's? The line of reasoning presented here suggests that
      perhaps the carbon-intercalant-carbon sandwich is
      superconducting; or perhaps even more carbon planes are
      involved. If superconductivity is a joint property of both
      carbon and intercalant planes, perhaps the higher
      T<sub>c</sub> of C<sub>8</sub>KHg than C<sub>4</sub>KHg is
      not the great surprise that it is sometimes made out to be.
      There is no reason that adding more carbon layers between the
      KHg trilayers should depress T<sub>c</sub> if the carbon
      layers are also superconducting. Those sceptics who insist
      that mercury must dominate superconductivity in the KHg-GIC's
      should reflect on the fact that the critical fields of
      C<sub>6</sub>K[<a href="node66.html#avdeev87">13</a>] are
      quite similar to those of C<sub>4</sub>KHg. C<sub>6</sub>K
      also has a T<sub>c</sub> of 1.5 K.[<a href=
      "node66.html#avdeev87">13</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Iye and Tanuma projected that a 3D-2D crossover might occur
      for the stage 3 KHg-GIC, where they estimated that
      <i>xi</i><sub>|| ^c</sub> I<sub>c</sub>.[<a href=
      "node66.html#iye82">120</a>] One can easily see that this
      estimate should not be appropriate if the carbon planes also
      participate in superconductivity. If the carbon planes that
      are adjacent to the intercalant layers are also
      superconducting, then it is their separation that should
      determine the coupling dimensionality. Presumably at a high
      enough stage the superconducting packages would be expected
      to decouple, but it is not clear what the correct length
      scale to describe this decoupling would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will a 3D-2D coupling-dimensionality crossover ever be seen
      in GIC's? The analogy with the TMDC's helps to clarify this
      question. When one takes a superconducting TMDC and
      intercalates it with an organic molecule, the molecules act
      as electron donors.[<a href="node66.html#thompson72">243</a>]
      Nonetheless, the organic molecules partially decouple the
      TMDC layers, raise the resistivity anisotropy,[<a href=
      "node66.html#thompson72">243</a>] and allow 2D
      superconductivity at low temperatures.[<a href=
      "node66.html#coleman83">46</a>] Molecular intercalants into
      GIC's act as electron acceptors, not donors.[<a href=
      "node66.html#I94">67</a>] As in the TMDCIC's, molecular
      intercalants in GIC's act to decouple the layers and raise
      the resistivity anisotropy.[<a href=
      "node66.html#mcrae88">166</a>] The analogy with the TMDCIC's
      leads one to suppose that acceptor should be 2D
      superconductors at a sufficiently low temperature. However,
      GIC's with molecular intercalants appear not to be
      superconducting.[<a href="node66.html#ericescy">64</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The lack of superconductivity in the acceptor GIC's is not
      that surprising if one believes that the cooperation of
      carbon and intercalant electrons is required. The intercalant
      bands are usually the major contribution to the c-axis
      conductivity, so the high resistivity anisotropy in these
      materials implies a low carrier density at the Fermi level in
      the intercalant bands. In fact, recent work, both
      experimental[<a href="node66.html#mcrae88">166</a>] and
      theoretical,[<a href="node66.html#E343">229</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#M325">230</a>] suggests that hopping conduction
      is responsible for c-axis transport in acceptor GIC's, at
      least for stages greater than one. Perhaps band conduction
      along the c-axis is a necessary condition for
      superconductivity in GIC's. That band conduction is not a
      sufficient condition for superconductivity is shown by the
      case of C<sub>6</sub>Li, which has the lowest resistivity
      anisotropy of any GIC,[<a href=
      "node66.html#mcrae88">166</a>], and yet is not
      superconducting.[<a href="node66.html#ericescy">64</a>] This
      problem deserves further investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one believes following Al-Jishi[<a href=
      "node66.html#M143">4</a>] that the presence of intercalant
      electrons at E<sub>F</sub> is necessary for
      superconductivity, then one possible implication may the
      non-existence of 2D superconductivity in GIC's. In other
      words, when one decouples the metallic planes with insulating
      intercalants in the TMDC's, one gets 2D superconductivity
      because the individual TMDC planes are themselves
      superconducting. In contrast, when one decouples the metallic
      carbon planes with insulating intercalants in the GIC's, one
      destroys superconductivity along with three-dimensionality.
      The Al-Jishi model may imply that three-dimensionality is
      needed for superconductivity in GIC's. These ideas lead back
      to the fundamental question of the nature of
      superconductivity in GIC's.
