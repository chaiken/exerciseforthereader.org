    <p>
      The study of high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductors is still very
      new, so the critical field properties are still being sorted
      out. Even though the number of papers published on the copper
      oxides must already be several times the number published on
      the TMDC's and the synthetic superlattices, there are several
      difficulties standing in the way of a consistent
      understanding of the properties of these materials. The
      principal experimental difficulty is the (currently
      unobtainable) high magnetic fields needed to measure
      H<sub>c2</sub> in an extensive temperature range, a problem
      which is exacerbated by the quite broad transitions seen in a
      magnetic field. Even pulsed magnetic field experiments do not
      allow measurement of H<sub>c2, _|_ ^c</sub> below about t =
      0.85,[<a href="node66.html#orlando87a">189</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#sakakibara87">211</a>] which means that any
      conclusions drawn must be considered tentative because of the
      limited magnetic field range of the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other major difficulty with the high-temperature critical
      field measurements so far is the uncertain theoretical
      picture of these new materials. Until a theory of high-
      T<sub>c</sub> superconductivity earns widespread acceptance,
      experimentalists must rely on the formulae of low-
      T<sub>c</sub> superconductivity, such as the WHHM theory and
      the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory (see Section 4.5).
      Interpretation of the data in terms of these models may well
      be misleading, but they are the best anyone can do under the
      present circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even with all these warnings in mind, the data that have been
      published so far on the high- T<sub>c</sub> materials are
      intriguing to those familiar with previous research on
      anisotropic superconductors. Some of the parameters from
      recent experiments on the high- T<sub>c</sub> superconductors
      are gathered in Table 2.4. The angular dependence of
      H<sub>c2</sub> measurements are the most straighforward to
      interpret since they are the least affected by magnetic field
      limitations. H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data taken so far
      shows that the 90 K rare-earth-barium-copper-oxide compounds
      are 3D superconductors, well fit by Eqn. 4.3.
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) results on
      HoBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>x</sub> from the work of
      Iye <em>et al.</em> are shown in 2.8.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
       <strong>Figure 2.8:</strong> H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)
      for a high- T<sub>c</sub> superconductor. From Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#iye87a">118</a>]. Each set of symbols
      corresponds to a different definition of H<sub>c2</sub>. For
      example, the curve labeled 0.7 R <sub>N</sub> was obtained by
      plotting versus <i>theta</i> the values of H that satisfy
      R(H,<i>theta</i>) = 0.7 R<sub>N</sub>. Each curve is also
      labeled in parentheses with the magnitude of the anisotropy
      parameter 1/<i>epsilon</i> that was used for the fit to Eqn.
      4.3.
    </p>
    <p>
      A series of H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) curves taken at
      different temperatures indicates that the anisotropy
      parameter <i>epsilon</i> is temperature-dependendent in these
      materials.[<a href="node66.html#iye87a">118</a>] A
      temperature-dependent <i>epsilon</i> has been widely observed
      in layered materials such as Nb<sub>(1 -
      x)</sub>Ta<sub>x</sub>Se<sub>2</sub>,[<a href=
      "node66.html#dalrymple84">51</a>] C<sub>8</sub>K[<a href=
      "node66.html#koike80">141</a>], C<sub>8</sub>KHg,[<a href=
      "node66.html#B340">35</a>] and Nb/Cu superlattices[<a href=
      "node66.html#chun84">42</a>], where it has been associated
      with positive curvature of H<sub>c2</sub>(T) . As noted
      previously, positive curvature of the critical field parallel
      to the layer planes (_|_ to the c-axis) may be associated
      with a dimensionality crossover, but the positive curvature
      often observed in H<sub>c2</sub> perpendicular to the layer
      planes must have a different cause. In the high-
      T<sub>c</sub> superconductors, positive curvature has been
      observed for both field orientations by some research
      groups,[<a href="node66.html#iye87">119</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#iye87a">118</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#moodera88">173</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#sakakibara87">211</a>] while a linear
      temperature dependence has been reported for both field
      orientations by others.[<a href=
      "node66.html#orlando87">188</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#orlando87a">189</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#uchida87b">255</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#vanbentum87">257</a>] Worthington <em>et
      al.</em>, on the other hand, see no sign of positive
      curvature, but instead a change in the linear slope of
      H<sub>c2</sub>.[<a href="node66.html#worthington87">268</a>]
      These disagreements about the positive curvature and
      temperature-dependent <i>epsilon</i> are reminiscent of a
      similar controversy about NbSe<sub>2</sub> in the '70's.[<a
      href="node66.html#foner73">87</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#muto73">181</a>] Whether the disparaties among
      the various research groups are due to differences in sample
      quality or slightly different methods of data analysis
      remains to be seen.

       <strong>Table 2.4:</strong> Selected properties of some of
      the high- T<sub>c</sub> superconductors. <i>dagger</i>
      indicates a single-crystal measurement. The coherence length
      quoted for ceramic sample is an average one. NR means that
      the parameter was not reported in the cited reference.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly a lot more work has to be done before the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(T) data in the copper-oxides can be
      understood. One of the major questions still to be answered
      is whether the superconductivity in these materials becomes
      two-dimensional at low temperatures. The good fit of Eqn. 4.3
      (rather than Tinkham's formula) to the data suggests that the
      copper-oxides are 3D superconductors at least in the
      temperature range accessible with currently obtainable
      fields. The coherence lengths which have been measured so far
      support the identification of 3D coupling.[<a href=
      "node66.html#worthington87">268</a>] However, a decoupling of
      the copper-oxygen planes is suggested by the fact that the
      presence of magnetic rare earth ions between the planes does
      not seem to suppress the transition temperature.[<a href=
      "node66.html#tamegai87">239</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#orlando87">188</a>] Also, Table 2.4 shows that
      the coherence length || to the c-axis is expected to be on
      the order of the c-axis lattice constant at low-temperature,
      which suggests that a coupling-dimensionality change might
      occur. For example, for
      HoBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>(7-y)</sub> the c-axis
      lattice parameter is 11.67 &Aring;[<a href=
      "node66.html#tamegai87">239</a>] and <i>xi</i><sub>||
      ^c</sub> is about 6.5 &Aring;. Plugging these numbers into
      Eqn. 2.4 gives r = 1.58, slightly less than the critical
      value of 1.7. Obviously estimates of this type are not to be
      taken too seriously considering the large extrapolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another interesting question is whether the copper-oxides'
      transition temperatures follow the predictions of the
      proximity effect. If the copper-oxygen planes are truly the
      superconducting layers, then putting several of them together
      without separation by an insulating layer should increase
      T<sub>c</sub>, according to proximity-effect models. Exactly
      this type of enhancement has been seen in the
      thallium-barium-calcium-copper-oxygen superconductors, where
      T<sub>c</sub> increases as a function of the number of
      copper-oxygen planes that are adjacent.[<a href=
      "node66.html#pool88">197</a>] Of course this T<sub>c</sub>
      behavior is not proof of proximity-effect behavior since
      another mechanism could easily be responsible if the pairing
      in these materials is non-conventional.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture from the currently available papers on high-
      T<sub>c</sub> superconductivity is obviously quite
      preliminary. So far they appear most like the transition
      metal dichalcogenides in their critical field properties:
      they have an anisotropy of about 5,
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) well-fit by Eqn. 4.3, and
      possible positive curvature of H<sub>c2</sub>(T) and
      temperature-dependent anisotropy. Even if the
      superconductivity of the high- T<sub>c</sub> materials turns
      out to be mediated by an exotic interaction, the comparison
      with the superconducting TMDC's and GIC's will still be
      instructive.
