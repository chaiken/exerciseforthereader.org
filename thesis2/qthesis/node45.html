      The impact of hydrogen on superconductivity in the transition
      metals bears some resemblance to the effect hydrogen has on
      the KH-GIC's. To be convinced of this, compare Figure <a
      href="node45.html#tmdcHfig"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />

      href="node44.html#khC_v"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      In both figures T<sub>c</sub> at first rises with increasing
      H content, reaching its maximum near x 0.1, and then falls to
      an unmeasurably low level at high x. ( T<sub>c</sub>
      ;SPM<sub>l</sub>t; 0.5 K for
      H<sub>0.87</sub>TaS<sub>2</sub>.[<a href=
      "node66.html#murphy75">179</a>]. This data point is not shown
      in Figure <a href="node45.html#tmdcHfig"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>.) T<sub>c</sub> also
      increases slightly for NbSe<sub>2</sub> when a small amount
      of hydrogen is added.[<a href="node66.html#murphy75">179</a>]
    </p>

       <strong>Figure:</strong> T<sub>c</sub> increase in
      TaS<sub>2</sub> induced by a) hydrogenation and b) pressure.
      a) From Ref. [<a href="node66.html#murphy75">179</a>]. The
      error bars represent the transition width, while the circles
      are the volume % superconducting. This experiment was
      performed on a powder sample. At a hydrogen concentration
      ofu.87, T<sub>c</sub> ;SPM<sub>l</sub>t; 0.5 K (not shown).
      b) From Ref. [<a href="node66.html#friend79">90</a>].
      T<sub>CDW</sub> is the CDW onset temperature, while
      T<sub>c</sub> is the usual superconducting transition
      temperature. 4H <sub>b</sub> and 2H are TaS<sub>2</sub>
      polytypes with different crystal structures.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The resemblance between the C<sub>8</sub>KH<sub>x</sub> and
      the TMDC data turns out to be mostly coincidence since the
      causes are probably quite different. The hydrogen-induced
      T<sub>c</sub> enhancement in the TMDC's TaS<sub>2</sub> and
      NbSe<sub>2</sub> is now known to be due to suppression of a
      charge-density wave transition that occurs in the
      unhydrogenated materials.[<a href=
      "node66.html#murphy75">179</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#friend79">90</a>] The charge-density wave can
      also be suppressed (and consequently T<sub>c</sub> can be
      increased) by intercalation, pressure, or dopants beside
      hydrogen.[<a href="node66.html#friend79">90</a>] CDW
      destruction by intercalation was briefly mentioned in Section
      <a href="#tmdc"><img width="13" height="13" align="bottom"
      alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. CDW
      suppression by pressure is illustrated in Figure <a href=
      "node45.html#tmdcHfig"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      b) for TaS<sub>2</sub>. CDW suppression by pressure is a
      general phenomenon for the CDW's of the layered TMDC's.[<a
      href="node66.html#friend79">90</a>] CDW destruction by
      impurities is exemplified in the system
      Nb<sub>1-x</sub>Ti<sub>x</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>.
      NbSe<sub>3</sub> has T<sub>c</sub> <b>&lt;</b> 50 mK, whereas
      the compound with x = 0.001 has T<sub>c</sub> 2.1 K.[<a href=
      "node66.html#fuller81">91</a>] The extreme sensitivity of the
      CDW to impurities has understandably resulted in great
      reproducibility problems with superconductivity in the
      TMDC's.[<a href="node66.html#fuller81">91</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The CDW-based explanation for T<sub>c</sub> enhancement in
      the TMDC's is fairly well-established because of the
      observation of a CDW in several different experiments. For
      example, Figure <a href="node45.html#tase2resist"><img width=
      "13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> show discontinuities in
      the resistivity of TaSe<sub>2</sub> due to a CDW
      transition.[<a href="node66.html#wilson74">264</a>] There can
      be no doubt that these high-temperature resistivity anomalies
      are due to CDW formation since the associated periodic
      lattice distortion has been directly observed using TEM,
      neutron scattering, and x-ray diffraction.[<a href=
      "node66.html#friend79">90</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#wilson74">264</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="3539" name="3539">&nbsp;</a><a id="tase2resist" name=

       <strong>Figure:</strong> In-plane resistivity
      discontinuities in TaSe<sub>2</sub> associated with CDW
      formation. From Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#wilson74">264</a>]. 1T- and 2H- refer to
      different polytypes (crystal structures). The CDW transitions
      occur at 473 K in 1T-TaSe<sub>2</sub> and at 117 K in
      2H-TaSe<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Notice that
      1T-TaSe<sub>2</sub> has a higher resistivity below its
      transition, whereas the resistivity of 2H-TaSe<sub>2</sub>
      decreases at its transition.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Except for 2H-NbS<sub>2</sub>, the CDW phenomenon occurs in
      all polytypes of all members of the class MX<sub>2</sub>,
      where M = V, Nb, or Ta, and X = S or Se.[<a href=
      "node66.html#friend79">90</a>] Of these materials, only
      2H-NbS<sub>2</sub> does not show a large T<sub>c</sub>
      enhancement with pressure. Since NbS<sub>2</sub> is also the
      only material which does not have a CDW transition, its
      comparatively small dT<sub>c</sub>/dP ( only 5&times;
      10<sup>-6</sup> K/bar) is evidence that CDW suppression is
      the cause of the dT<sub>c</sub>/dP in the other
      MX<sub>2</sub> materials.[<a href=
      "node66.html#friend79">90</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#smith72">217</a>] A host of experiments show
      that perturbations (such as pressure, hydrogen, and
      impurities) tend to rapidly increase T<sub>c</sub> up to the
      point where the CDW is suppressed, whereas they affect
      T<sub>c</sub> only slowly above the CDW transition. For
      example, NbSe<sub>2</sub> has a large dT<sub>c</sub>/dP (4.95
      &times; 10 <sup>-5</sup> K/bar) for pressures below 35 kbar,
      the pressure where the CDW is completely suppressed. Above 35
      kbar, the slope is only dT<sub>c</sub>/dP = 2.8 &times;
      10<sup>-6</sup> K/bar, even smaller than that in
      NbS<sub>2</sub>.[<a href="node66.html#smith72">217</a>]
      Obviously this is no coincidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thrust of many of the superconductivity experiments on
      the TMDC's is that there is a competition between the
      superconducting and CDW transitions, so that preventing one
      condensed state encourages the other one. This line of
      reasoning says that once the CDW is completely suppressed by
      a perturbation, a material reaches its intrinsic magnitude of
      T<sub>c</sub>.[<a href="node66.html#fuller81">91</a>] By
      ``intrinsic'', one means the T<sub>c</sub> value that would
      be expected from the usual theories given
      <i>theta</i><sub>D</sub>, <i>Lambda</i><sub>ep</sub>, etc.
      Further application of the perturbation may then either
      increase or decrease T<sub>c</sub>, depending on the
      properties of the individual superconductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason that CDW's and superconductivity compete with one
      another is quite simple. In the BCS theory of
      superconductivity,[<a href="node66.html#bcs">16</a>] the
      condensation energy of the superconducting state is 1/2 N(0)
      <i>Delta</i><sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>, where
      <i>Delta</i><sub>s</sub> is the superconducting energy gap.
      In a similar mean-field theory of the charge-density wave
      transition, the condensation energy is also proportional to
      N(0) <i>Delta</i><sub>CDW</sub><sup>2</sup> (with some
      additional multiplicative factors),[<a href=
      "node66.html#rice73">204</a>] where
      <i>Delta</i><sub>CDW</sub> is now the CDW energy gap. The
      juxtaposition of these two expressions for the condensation
      energy immediately shows why the two phases tend not to
      coexist: they both need to create a gap at the Fermi surface.
      Once the Fermi surface has a gap above it, any further phase
      transition driven by an instability of the Fermi sea is
      completely suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In real metals, a CDW transition tends to gap only a portion
      of the Fermi surface, leaving some condensation energy
      available for use in a superconducting transition. Thus a
      high-temperature CDW transition tends merely to lower
      T<sub>c</sub> and not to altogether prevent
      superconductivity. Bilbro and McMillan found a relationship
      between the amount that the superconducting transition
      temperature is lowered by a higher-temperature CDW phase
      transition and the amount of Fermi surface which is removed
      in that transition.[<a href="node66.html#bilbro76">23</a>]
      The relationship is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="bilbro" name="bilbro">&nbsp;</a><img align="bottom"
      alt="" src="img117.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      where T<sub>c</sub> is the CDW-suppressed superconducting
      transition temperature, T<sub>c0</sub> is the intrinsic
      transition temperature, T<sub>CDW</sub> is the CDW onset
      temperature, and N<sub>1</sub>/N is the fraction of the
      density-of-states removed in the CDW transition. Fuller,
      Chaikin, and Ong[<a href="node66.html#fuller81">91</a>]
      obtained N<sub>1</sub>/N as a function of pressure P in
      NbSe<sub>3</sub> by measuring the size of the resistivity
      discontinuity at T<sub>CDW</sub>(P). The result is
      N<sub>1</sub>/N = (0.6 - 0.18p), where p is the pressure in
      kbar. Fuller and coauthors[<a href=
      "node66.html#fuller81">91</a>] used these numbers in
      conjunction with Eqn. <a href="node45.html#bilbro"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> to fit their
      T<sub>c</sub>(P) data, and found good agreement at low
      pressures.
    </p>
    <p>
      This agreement is convincing evidence that CDW-suppression of
      superconductivity is indeed due to the competition of the two
      condensed phases for the Fermi surface. Any perturbation of
      the materials that tends to suppress the CDW, such as
      pressure, hydrogenation, or intercalation, will therefore
      also tend to increase T<sub>c</sub>. The enhancement of
      T<sub>c</sub> by hydrogenation in the TMDC's obviously is due
      to a very different mechanism than that which has been put
      forward for the transition metals and the alkali-metal GIC's.
      Since hydrogen first increases and then depresses
      T<sub>c</sub> in C<sub>8</sub>K, one might wonder whether
      CDW's might also play a role. This possibility is discussed
      below in connection with the results on the KHg-GIC's. Before
      relating the outcome of the hydrogenation experiments on the
      KHg-GIC's, the details of the experiments are briefly
      described.
