      The superconducting transitions were measured by monitoring
      the ac susceptibility of the sample as the temperature or
      magnetic field was swept. An ac inductance bridge was used to
      record the sample's susceptibility. The homemade inductance
      bridge, which is sketched in Figure <a href=
      "node26.html#ibridge"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      was composed of a primary solenoid, around which two
      counterwound secondary solenoids about half the length of the
      primary were placed. The secondaries were balanced to within
      about 2 microvolts under the typical operating conditions of
      the experiment. The off-balance voltage included
      contributions from the sample holder and small unavoidable
      differences between the secondaries. This voltage was nulled
      by using the zero adjust knob on the lock-in amplifier (see
      Figure <a href="node26.html#schematic"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ) before the field and
      temperature sweeps began. Several different versions of the
      inductance bridge were used in the early zero-field
      experiments, but all critical field measurements reported
      here were done with the same unit.

      The fraction of a sample which is superconducting can be
      estimated in the inductive measurements because the
      transition height is proportional to the fraction of the
      primary coil which is filled with superconducting material.
      The exact expression, from Faraday's Law in cgs units,
      is:<br />

      where V<sub>secondary</sub> is the superconducting transition
      height, A is the effective area of the superconducting
      material in the direction perpendicular to the primary
      modulation field, B<sub>mod</sub> is the modulation field,
      and <i>Omega</i><sub>mod</sub> is the modulation frequency.
      The dependence on the area perpendicular to the modulation
      field comes from the fact that this area determines the
      time-rate of change of magnetic flux in Faraday's Law. Here
      <i>alpha</i> is a dimensionless constant of the order of
      unity which takes into account the coupling of the primary
      coil to the secondary. This constant can in principle be
      calculated[<a href="node66.html#abel64">2</a>], but in
      practice it is preferable to simply measure alpha by filling
      the primary coil completely with a superconducting material,
      so that A = A<sub>coil</sub>. Once <i>alpha</i> is determined
      in this way, a measurement of the transition height for a
      given specimen gives its superconducting cross-sectional
      area. From knowledge of the sample's total area, an estimate
      of the fraction which is superconducting (fraction =
      A<sub>superconducting</sub>/ A<sub>total</sub>) can be made,
      as discussed below.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that this areal fraction is an upper
      bound on the <em>volume</em> fraction of superconductivity.
      To see why, consider the case where the modulation field is
      applied along ^z, so that the contribution to the signal
      comes from planes of constant <b>z</b> from <b>z</b>=0 to
      <b>z</b>=L. [See Figure <a href="node26.html#scingfract"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>.] Portions of the sample
      at all positions along the coil axis can contribute equally
      to the effective area. For a given position (x,y) in the
      cross-section, though, only one volume element can
      contribute. This volume element will screen all others at the
      same (x,y) position, so that A is really the area of the
      projection along ^z of all the superconducting volume
      elements onto a plane of constant <b>z</b>. Therefore the
      cases where 100% of the volume superconducts and just one
      full sheet (say that at <b>z</b>=L) superconducts cannot be
      distinguished by this technique.

      The inductance bridge used in the critical field measurements
      was calibrated by filling its end with aluminum foil. The
      foil had a T<sub>c</sub> of 1.1 K (in surprisingly good
      agreement with tabulated values[<a href=
      "node66.html#ashcroft76">10</a>]) with a transition height of
      38 <i>mu</i>V. The thermal drift of the inductance bridge
      off-balance is about 50 nV/K, so it is estimated that the
      minimum observable transition height is about 100 nV. From
      the known area of the primary coil of 50.3 mm<sup>2</sup>, it
      was estimated that the transition height of a typical GIC
      should be about 5 <i>mu</i>V, as was indeed the case. Thus
      the inductive experiment should be sensitive to
      superconductivity in about 2% of a typical sample.
      Unfortunately, repositioning a large GIC inside the primary
      coil changed its transition height by as much as a factor of
      5. This variation occurs because the secondary coil is not
      much longer than the sample, and the secondary is much more
      sensitive to inductance changes near its center than near its
      end. A larger inductance bridge could not be accomodated
      inside the available <sup>3</sup>He refrigerators.

      As a practical matter, the GIC's used in these experiments
      are thought to be fairly homogeneous on a macroscopic scale.
      Therefore, in general the effective areal fraction of
      superconductivity should be approximately the volume one as
      well. In the cases where the GIC's were multiphased, the
      matter of superconducting volume and screening deserves more
      thought, as discussed in Section <a href=
      "node46.html#khghydexp"><img width="13" height="13" align=

      The full data acquisition system is sketched in Figure <a

      </a> . The primary excitation current was supplied by an
      oscillator, either one inside the lock-in amplifier, or an
      external one attached to the lock-in's reference port. The
      usual excitation current was 1 milliampere at 490 Hz. This
      frequency was chosen because it seemed to be particularly
      free of electrical noise. Neither the critical fields nor
      T<sub>c</sub> obtained from this apparatus were found to be
      sensitive to either the magnitude or frequency of the primary
      current. The primary magnetic field produced under this
      excitation was calculated to be 0.17 oersteds (compared to
      the 0.2 oersteds at 27 Hz used in Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#iye82">120</a>]). These conditions were
      sufficient to give a typical signal-to-noise ratio of about
      1000, with the superconducting transition height usually
      between 5 and 10 microvolts. The detailed theory of operation
      of an inductance bridge circuit is described in Ref. [<a
      href="node66.html#abel64">2</a>].
    </p>
    <p>
      The output signal of the inductance bridge was filtered by
      the lock-in, and the lock-in's output was fed to the y-input
      of a flatbed plotter. The x-input for temperature sweeps was
      either the voltage across a calibrated germanium resistor
      (Lake Shore GR-200A-100), or the dc output of a capacitive
      pressure sensor (MKS Baratron) which was attached to the
      <sup>3</sup>He refrigerator. The temperature derived from the
      pressure sensor was in excellent agreement (the disagreement
      about the same as the interpolation error) with that obtained
      from the germanium resistor down to about 1.0 K, below which
      deviations increased with decreasing temperature. At the
      lowest temperatures (T 0.4 K), the germanium resistor
      consistently showed readings about 30% higher than those of
      the <sup>3</sup>He vapor pressure under hard pumping, with
      the thermometer reaching agreement with the vapor pressure to
      within a few percent after about one hour's wait. The
      implication here is that a well-calibrated thermometer is
      essential for work below 1.0 K. At the lowest temperatures,
      the reading of the thermometer was always recorded in
      preference to the vapor-pressure-derived temperature. The
      magnetoresistance of the thermometer was negligible
      throughout the magnetic field range of interest, and was not
      corrected for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the question of agreement between the temperature
      sensors, there is also the problem of thermal equilibrium
      between the temperature sensors and the sample. The sample
      tube contained about 200 torr of helium gas intended to
      provide thermal contact of the GIC to the bath and to
      minimize any temperature lag. Furthermore, the sample was
      allowed to sit at constant temperature for about five minutes
      prior to each field sweep if the temperature had been
      changed. The actual degree of equilibration that was achieved
      with these precautions can be estimated by comparing the
      values of T<sub>c</sub> obtained in heating and cooling
      temperature sweeps. In general, the offset between the values
      of T<sub>c</sub> measured in heating and cooling was on the
      order of 10 mK, indicating that equilibrium between
      temperature sensors and sample was nearly achieved. The
      offset between the sensors and the GIC is probably the
      largest source of error in the determination of T<sub>c</sub>
      for reasonably narrow superconducting transitions. This
      offset is also one of the most important sources of error in
      H<sub>c2</sub>(T) measurements at low temperatures.

      The magnetic field was supplied by a set of homemade
      water-cooled copper Helmholtz coils about 2 feet in diameter
      and separated by about the same distance. No difficulties
      with hysteresis were encountered in using this magnet. With
      the largest available power supply, a pair of Hewlett Packard
      Model 8012A supplies connected in series, the magnet could be
      swept up to a field of about 1000 oersteds at about 30
      amperes, which was adequate for the C<sub>4</sub>KHg critical
      field measurements. The field was calibrated with a Hall
      probe against the output of a potentiometer on the sweep
      control of the power supply. This sweep control was built by
      Bruce Brandt of the National Magnet Laboratory. No effort was
      made to screen out the earth's field, as its contribution to
      the experimental errors was thought to be inconsequential
      overall. The largest source of inaccuracy in the critical
      field measurements was in the field calibration, as the exact
      value of the field inside the Helmholtz coils was
      position-sensitive, varying by as much as 10% over the
      distance of an inch. However, since the field versus
      potentiometer calibration is linear, any inaccuracies in
      sample position or calibration should change only the
      magnitude of the data curves, not their shape. Because of the
      possible errors in sample mounting and field calibration, it
      is estimated that the critical field at a given orientation
      and temperature could be off by as much as 15% in either
      direction. However, the ratio of the values of H<sub>c2</sub>
      at two different angles or temperatures is known considerably
      more accurately, perhaps to within about &plusmn; 5% of the
      measured value.

    <p>
      Most of the data described in this chapter were obtained
      using a <sup>3</sup>He closed-cycle refrigeration system
      built by Mike Blaho of the National Magnet Laboratory. The
      inductance bridge was attached to a standard <sup>3</sup>He
      probe loaded into a <sup>3</sup>He refrigerator which was
      immersed into a <sup>4</sup>He bath. The germanium resistor
      was glued directly to the bridge in order to insure good
      thermal contact to the sample. The recirculation system and
      refrigerator are of standard design.[<a href=
      "node66.html#betts76">20</a>] Some of the data above 0.9 K
      were taken in a single-shot <sup>4</sup>He evaporator
      cryostat. No discrepancy was found between these and the
      <sup>3</sup>He experiments.
