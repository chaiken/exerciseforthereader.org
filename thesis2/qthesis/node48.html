    <p>
      Any model for the effect of hydrogen on C<sub>4</sub>KHg must
      not only account for the T<sub>c</sub> increase but also be
      consistent with other relevant experiments. Before
      conjecturing what the cause of the rise in T<sub>c</sub>
      might be, it is useful to review some of these other
      experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most researchers who have worked with the KHg-GIC's have not
      measured the superconducting transition temperature. This is
      entirely understandable considering the time-consuming and
      expensive nature of the <sup>3</sup>He experiments.
      Unfortunately, the lack of T<sub>c</sub> characterization in
      most papers on C<sub>4</sub>KHg limits their helpfulness for
      understanding the sample dependence of T<sub>c</sub> and the
      hydrogen-induced enhancement. Unless the type of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg sample used by another group is known, it is
      hard to know how their data fit into the overall picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ideally, the most helpful type of information on
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg would be measurements of a physical property
      (besides T<sub>c</sub>) that was different in pink and
      unhydrogenated gold samples, but the same in pink and
      hydrogenated gold samples. Despite many attempts to find such
      a property (described in Section <a href=
      "node15.html#charac"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      ), no such measurement is currently known.
    </p>
    <p>
      One set of data does have special significance for the
      interpretation of the hydrogenation experiments: the
      measurements of T<sub>c</sub> as a function of applied
      pressure in the KHg-GIC's performed by DeLong and
      collaborators.[<a href="node66.html#delong82">56</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#delong82a">58</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#delong83">55</a>] Figure <a href=
      "node48.html#stitcvsP"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      a) shows the superconducting transition as a function of
      pressure for a C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimen which had
      T<sub>c</sub> 1.3 K and <i>Delta</i> T<sub>c</sub>/
      T<sub>c</sub> 0.31 at room pressure. The dramatic sharpening
      of the transition (final <i>Delta</i> T<sub>c</sub>/
      T<sub>c</sub> 2e-2) and shift of T<sub>c</sub> to
      approximately 1.5 K under the very small applied pressure of
      0.8 kbar are remarkably similar to the effect of
      hydrogenation. The smallness of an applied pressure of 0.8
      kbar can best be appreciated by noting that dT<sub>c</sub>/dP
      in C<sub>8</sub>KHg is about -6.5&times; 10 <sup>-5</sup>
      K/bar,[<a href="node66.html#delong82a">58</a>] so that 0.8
      kbar of applied pressure shifts T<sub>c</sub> in
      C<sub>8</sub>KHg by only about 50 mK. In both the
      hydrogenation and pressure experiments, a minute perturbation
      to the sample radically narrows the superconducting
      transition and increases T<sub>c</sub>.

       <strong>Figure:</strong> Pressure dependence of
      T<sub>c</sub> in KHg-GIC's. From Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#delong83">55</a>]. a) Pressure-induced
      transition narrowing in C<sub>4</sub>KHg. Notice that the
      application of a small pressure, 0.8 kbar, increases
      T<sub>c</sub> to 1.5 K, while application of further pressure
      decreases T<sub>c</sub> at a rate dT<sub>c</sub>/dP =
      -5&times;10<sup>-5</sup> K/bar. b) Monotonic decline of
      T<sub>c</sub> with pressure in C<sub>8</sub>KHg.
      dT<sub>c</sub>/dP = -6.5&times;10<sup>-5</sup> K/bar.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The large sensitivity of the superconductivity in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg to small pressures is particularly
      interesting to contrast with the slow monotonic decrease of
      T<sub>c</sub> with pressure in C<sub>8</sub>KHg.[<a href=
      "node66.html#delong82a">58</a>] The slow decline of
      T<sub>c</sub> with pressure that is observed in
      C<sub>8</sub>KHg is typical of nearly-free-electron
      metals.[<a href="node66.html#delong82a">58</a>]
      Nearly-free-electron character is a reasonable model for the
      KHg-GIC's since band structure calculations[<a href=
      "node66.html#senbetu85">215</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#holzwarth88">112</a>] show substantial
      intercalant <b>s</b> and <b>p</b> character at the Fermi
      level. Therefore the behavior of C<sub>8</sub>KHg could be
      considered conventional, whereas the transition narrowing
      observed in C<sub>4</sub>KHg is quite anomalous. At pressures
      above the initial discontinuity in T<sub>c</sub>, the
      pressure dependence of C<sub>4</sub>KHg also becomes
      conventional, with dT<sub>c</sub>/dP = -5&times;
      10<sup>-5</sup> K/bar.[<a href="node66.html#delong83">55</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      As pointed out by DeLong and Eklund,[<a href=
      "node66.html#delong82a">58</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#delong83">55</a>] the T<sub>c</sub>(P)
      experiments on the KHg-GIC's are reminiscent of those on the
      transition metal dichalcogenides. In Section <a href=
      "node42.html#otherhyd"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      the strong T<sub>c</sub> increase with low pressure of
      NbSe<sub>2</sub> was contrasted with the weak T<sub>c</sub>
      increase with pressure of NbS<sub>2</sub>.[<a href=
      "node66.html#smith72">217</a>] The large low-pressure
      magnitude dT<sub>c</sub>/dP of NbSe<sub>2</sub> is attributed
      to the suppression of a CDW. Once the CDW of NbSe<sub>2</sub>
      has been destroyed by pressure, its dT<sub>c</sub>/dP is
      almost the same as that of the non-CDW compound
      NbS<sub>2</sub>.[<a href="node66.html#smith72">217</a>] The
      CDW material NbSe<sub>3</sub> and its non-CDW relative
      TaSe<sub>3</sub> also show dT<sub>c</sub>/dP behavior similar
      to the NbSe<sub>2</sub>/NbS<sub>2</sub> pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      DeLong and Eklund have proposed that C<sub>4</sub>KHg and
      C<sub>8</sub>KHg might be such a CDW/non-CDW matched pair.[<a
      href="node66.html#delong83">55</a>] According to this model,
      the initially broad transition of C<sub>4</sub>KHg is due to
      the presence in some of the sample of a CDW state that is
      gapping part of the Fermi surface. The portion of the sample
      that supported a CDW would have a depressed T<sub>c</sub>,
      whereas the non-CDW part of the sample would have
      T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K. When a small amount of pressure
      destroys the CDW, the whole material has the intrinsic
      T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an alternative theory, DeLong and Eklund[<a href=
      "node66.html#delong83">55</a>] proposed that the pressure
      drives an ordering transition in C<sub>4</sub>KHg. They
      mention the improvement of long-range order in the
      intercalant layers or an improvement in stacking fidelity as
      possible ordering transitions. However, there are good
      reasons why an order-disorder transition is unlikely to
      produce the behavior seen in Figure <a href=
      "node48.html#stitcvsP"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      a). First, T<sub>c</sub> in most superconductors is not
      usually as sensitive to crystallographic order as the
      hydrogenation and pressure data would suggest. There are many
      examples of disordered superconductors with T<sub>c</sub>'s
      close to those of single crystals. Other superconducting
      properties such as the critical fields and currents are much
      more sensitive to crystalline order than T<sub>c</sub>.
      (These transport properties depend directly on the
      mean-free-path, as discussed in Section <a href=
      "node35.html#models"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The other reason that the disorder-order hypothesis seems
      unlikely is much more fundamental. This second argument,
      which is based on thermodynamic considerations, is due to
      Clarke and Uher.[<a href="node66.html#clarke84">43</a>] The
      Clarke-Uher argument is based on the observation that the
      change of shape of the superconducting transition is almost
      entirely reversible. As Figure <a href=
      "node48.html#stitcvsP"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      shows, when applied pressure is released from a
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimen that had been pressurized up to 8
      kbar, the sample's superconducting transition returns almost
      exactly to its original shape. The small amount of deviation
      between the original and final room-pressure transitions can
      probably be attributed to plastic deformation of the sample.
      If the effect of pressure were genuinely to force a
      disorder-order transition, then one would expect the material
      to remain ordered when the pressure is removed. The reason is
      that the part of the Helmholtz free energy (F = E <b>-</b>
      TS) which favors the formation of a disordered phase is the
      entropic term. The entropic contribution to the free energy
      is proportional to temperature, which is the formal
      justification for the observation that higher temperatures
      encourage the formation of disordered phases. Metastable
      disordered phases do exist at low temperatures since their
      rate of transformation is suppressed due to the lack of
      thermal energy. However, should disordered material be
      transformed to ordered material at low temperature by the
      application of pressure, basic thermodynamics suggests that
      the materials should remain ordered since the entropic forces
      driving disorder are effectively zero at 1 K.
    </p>
    <p>
      These thermodynamic considerations suggest that a
      non-hysteretic low-temperature transformation must be of the
      order-order rather than disorder-order variety. Order-order
      transitions can be driven by the energy term in the
      free-energy, and so do not always require thermally assisted
      growth. In metallurgy a transformation which is not thermally
      assisted is called displacive or martensitic.[<a href=
      "node66.html#christian81">41</a>] One type of martensitic
      transition is the charge-density wave transition already
      discussed in connection with the TMDC experiments.[<a href=
      "node66.html#fuller81">91</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      There is additional evidence to support the identification of
      the hydrogen- and pressure-induced transformation as an
      order-order transition. If the difference between the low-
      T<sub>c</sub> and T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K material were merely
      the degree of disorder, then it should be impossible to make
      a low- T<sub>c</sub> sample with a sharp transition. Yet
      Table <a href="node47.html#hydtctable"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> shows that one gold
      specimen had <i>Delta</i> T<sub>c</sub>/ T<sub>c</sub> only
      7&times; 10<sup>-2</sup>, comparable to the width of the
      better T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K samples. It is true that the
      lower T<sub>c</sub> samples tend to have broader transitions,
      but this is probably just an indication that the lower-
      T<sub>c</sub> phase is harder to grow. If the <i>beta</i>
      phase is metastable, it seems sensible that it would be
      harder to grow in a well-ordered condition than the
      putatively stable <i>alpha</i> phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      The importance of the T<sub>c</sub>-versus-pressure
      experiments is therefore twofold. One contribution of the
      pressure experiments is to reinforce the evidence from the
      hydrogenation experiments that the low- T<sub>c</sub> phase
      can be destroyed by very small perturbations. The vital
      contribution of the pressure experiment is that the
      reversibility of the transformation shows it to be an
      order-order transition, not the disorder-order transformation
      also suggested by DeLong and Eklund.[<a href=
      "node66.html#delong83">55</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The next logical question is why the low-temperature ordering
      should be a CDW transition rather than an ordinary structural
      phase transition. C<sub>8</sub>K has a structural phase
      transition near 13 kbar to a T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K phase, as
      discussed in Section <a href="node39.html#critfdisc"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>.[<a href=
      "node66.html#delong83">55</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#avdeev87">13</a>] The high-pressure phase has a
      <i>sqrt</i>3 &times; <i>sqrt</i>3R30 &deg; structure.[<a
      href="node66.html#clarke84">43</a>] It seems reasonable to
      ask whether the low- T<sub>c</sub> material in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg could not also undergo a structural phase
      transition to a higher- T<sub>c</sub> phase. As remarked in
      Section <a href="node18.html#neutrons"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> , there is evidence from
      the neutron scattering experiments that all lower-
      T<sub>c</sub> samples contain both the <i>alpha</i> and
      <i>beta</i> phases of C<sub>4</sub>KHg. Therefore one might
      well hypothesize that the effect of hydrogen and pressure is
      simply to transform the <i>beta</i> phase material into
      <i>alpha</i> phase. This hypothesis explains all the
      superconductivity data quite well, but it runs afoul of the
      neutron diffraction data. In a neutron-diffraction study, Kim
      and coworkers found no evidence for a change in the relative
      abundance of the <i>alpha</i> and <i>beta</i> phases up to
      13.8 kbar.[<a href="node66.html#kim84">130</a>] The fraction
      of <i>beta</i> phase in the neutron diffraction sample was 2%
      both at 1 atm and 13.8 kbar. Kim <em>et el.</em> also saw no
      evidence from the diffraction patterns for ordering of the
      sample or for changes in the relative intensities of the
      peaks up to 13.8 kbar.[<a href="node66.html#kim84">130</a>]
      This neutron diffraction study effectively rules out any
      structural phase transition explanation for the data of
      DeLong and Eklund.[<a href="node66.html#delong83">55</a>]
      Since it appears highly probable that hydrogenation has the
      same effect as pressure, the data of Kim and coworkers appear
      to rule out a structural phase transition explanation for the
      hydrogen experiment as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary objection to the hypothesis of CDW formation in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg has to be why a CDW has not been observed in
      any of the aforementioned diffraction experiments. An answer
      to this question has been put forward by Wilson, DiSalvo, and
      Mahajan, the discovers of charge-density waves in the
      TMDC's.[<a href="node66.html#wilson74">264</a>] After the
      periodic lattice distortion associated with CDW formation was
      discovered in TaSe<sub>2</sub> using electron diffraction, an
      intensive search for superlattice lines was made with x-ray
      and neutron diffraction. Even when researchers knew where
      these lines were, observing them with x-rays was still quite
      difficult, requiring special equipment and long exposure
      times.[<a href="node66.html#wilson75">265</a>] Wilson <em>et
      al.</em> explain that the observation of CDW's is made much
      easier by the dynamical diffraction that occurs with electron
      beams, but not with photon or neutron beams.[<a href=
      "node66.html#wilson75">265</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Timp[<a href="node66.html#K167">246</a>] performed extensive
      electron microscopy studies on C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples, but
      he never reports any observations below room temperature.
      Because CDW's are easily observed only with electron
      diffraction[<a href="node66.html#wilson75">265</a>] or
      nowadays, with a scanning tunnelling microscope,[<a href=
      "node66.html#coleman85">47</a>] there seems to have been no
      experimental opportunity to see a possible CDW in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg. An estimate can be made of the hypothetical
      CDW transition temperature in C<sub>4</sub>KHg using Eqn. <a
      href="node45.html#bilbro"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      To calculate T<sub>CDW</sub>, let the intrinsic T<sub>c</sub>
      of C<sub>4</sub>KHg == T<sub>c0</sub> be 1.5 K. Let the
      suppressed T<sub>c</sub> be 0.8 K. The fraction of the Fermi
      surface which is removed by a CDW transition,
      N<sub>1</sub>/N, can be estimated by using the BCS formula
      for T<sub>c</sub>, assuming the same Debye temperature and
      same BCS interaction parameter V for both transition
      temperatures. The result is that removal of about 11% of the
      Fermi surface will account for the observed T<sub>c</sub>
      depression in the gold C<sub>4</sub>KHg phase. Plugging this
      fraction into Eqn. <a href="node45.html#bilbro"><img width=
      "13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> gives T<sub>CDW</sub> =
      243 K. This is a <em>very</em> rough estimate for
      T<sub>CDW</sub> since Eqn. <a href="node45.html#bilbro"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> is exponentially
      dependent on the fraction of FS removed by the CDW
      transition. Nonetheless, this estimate gives one hope that a
      CDW transition may yet be observed in C<sub>4</sub>KHg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before moving on to further discussion of the CDW hypothesis,
      it is worth discussing a few alternative ideas. The
      possibilities of a disorder-order transition or an
      order-order structural phase transition can be safely
      eliminated, for reasons discussed above. The optic-phonons
      explanation of T<sub>c</sub> enhancement by hydrogen that is
      applicable to the transition metals is not promising for
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg. The reason that the optic-phonons picture
      seems unsuitable here is that it cannot explain why after
      hydrogenation all samples have the same T<sub>c</sub>, 1.5 K.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more suitable possibility might be an explanation based
      on the electronic properties of C<sub>4</sub>KHg rather than
      the lattice modes or structure. Roth and coworkers[<a href=
      "node66.html#H242">207</a>] proposed a model in which a
      reduction in carrier density due to hydrogenation lowered the
      Fermi level until it resided in a density-of-states maximum.
      The idea was that this maximum density-of-states would
      correspond to a T<sub>c</sub> of 1.5 K, and that all
      subsequent perturbations would move the Fermi level away from
      the maximum and consequently depress T<sub>c</sub>. Roth
      <em>et al.</em> hypothesized that mercury vacancies might be
      responsible for a lower T<sub>c</sub> in some samples since
      the T<sub>c</sub> of KHg alloys monotonically increases with
      increasing mercury content.[<a href=
      "node66.html#roberts76">205</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this electronic-structure-based proposal was made,
      evidence has accumulated that mercury stoichiometry does not
      differ significantly among higher- and lower- T<sub>c</sub>
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples. This evidence was reviewed in
      Section <a href="node19.html#chemanal"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> . One might wonder
      whether the coexistence of the <i>alpha</i> and <i>beta</i>
      phases in the lower- T<sub>c</sub> C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimens
      might not shift the Fermi level enough to lower the
      density-of-states and suppress T<sub>c</sub>. This
      possibility is not out of the question, but the similarity of
      the pressure and hydrogenation data between the TMDC's and
      the GIC's is powerful evidence for the CDW hypothesis.
      Furthermore, the very small amount of pressure or hydrogen
      needed to increase T<sub>c</sub> strongly hints that a phase
      transition is involved.

      Up to this point there has been no justification for the
      claim that C<sub>4</sub>KHg is the type of solid expected to
      undergo a charge-density wave transition. This is no accident
      considering that the CDW phenomenon, like superconductivity,
      is a subtle collective effect that depends on the details of
      band structure, lattice modes, and electron-phonon coupling.
      The best argument for a charge-density wave in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg would seem to be that its Fermi surface, as
      calculated by Holzwarth[<a href=
      "node66.html#holzwarth88">112</a>] (see Figure <a href=
      "node38.html#holzfs"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      ), is quite similar to that of the TMDC's. According to
      Holzwarth, a CDW transition in C<sub>4</sub>KHg seems
      possible, but the degree of nesting is very sensitive to the
      proposed splitting[<a href="node66.html#elmakrini80">70</a>]
      of the mercury layers in C<sub>4</sub>KHg.[<a href=
      "node66.html#holzwarth88a">113</a>] The similarity of the
      C<sub>8</sub>K Fermi surface to that of TaS<sub>2</sub> was
      previously noted by Inoshita,[<a href=
      "node66.html#inoshita77">115</a>] who found a possible Fermi
      surface nesting wavevector. The hypothetical nesting
      wavevector for C<sub>8</sub>K is shown in Figure <a href=
      "node48.html#nesting"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .

      If a CDW does occur in C<sub>4</sub>KHg, it should be visible
      in other experiments besides electron diffraction. For
      example, a discontinuity in resistivity or susceptibility
      might occur. Published resistivity and susceptibility data do
      show interesting anomalies, but at different temperatures.[<a
      href="node66.html#elmakrini80b">72</a>] The basal-plane
      resistivity undergoes a change in slope at about 200 K in
      both C<sub>4</sub>KHg and C<sub>4</sub>RbHg, as illustrated
      in Figure <a href="node48.html#stitransdata"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>a). The magnetic
      susceptibility is flat at 200 K but shows a small anomaly at
      about 50 K. Notice that resistivity and susceptibility
      anomalies are not observed for the stage 2 specimens. It
      would be informative to repeat these measurements, especially
      on GIC's whose T<sub>c</sub>'s have been measured.

    <p>
      A summary of the CDW hypothesis for C<sub>4</sub>KHg is in
      order. The basic picture is that proposed by DeLong and
      Eklund.[<a href="node66.html#delong83">55</a>] This picture
      relies heavily on analogies to the much-studied transition
      metal dichalcogenides. In almost any reasonable model, the
      main difference between the pink and gold phases of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg is that the gold samples contain the
      <i>beta</i> phase. Specific to the model described here is
      the idea that the <i>beta</i> phase is unstable to the
      formation of a CDW which opens a gap on some of the Fermi
      surface at a temperature well above T<sub>c</sub>. The
      removal of some of the FS lowers T<sub>c</sub> in the gold
      samples from the intrinsic value of 1.5 K to about 0.8 K.
      Hydrogenation and pressure suppress the CDW, presumably by
      destroying the FS nesting. Destruction of the CDW close its
      gap, and restores T<sub>c</sub> to 1.5 K. Removal of pressure
      allows reformation of the CDW and a return of T<sub>c</sub>
      to 0.8 K. This model is by no means proven, but it explains
      all the available data and is reasonable because of the
      similarity of the superconducting GIC's and TMDC's.
