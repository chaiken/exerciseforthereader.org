      Anisotropic superconductivity is the fastest-growing
      condensed-matter physics subfield of the late 1980's. The
      primary boom has been in the high-temperature
      superconductivity industry, which was created seemingly
      overnight by Bednorz and M&uuml;ller's astonishing discovery
      of over-30 K superconductivity in
      La<sub>5-x</sub>Ba<sub>x</sub>Cu<sub>5</sub>O<sub>y</sub>.[<a
      href="node66.html#muller87">178</a>] The subsequent
      observation of 90 K superconductivity in
      YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>[<a href=
      "node66.html#wu87">269</a>] changed the character of
      superconductivity research forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even before the attention of the physics community was
      focussed on the new high- T<sub>c</sub> materials, the field
      of superconductivity was far from dormant. There were
      contributions from superconductivity research to many
      different disciplines, such as the influence of granular
      superconductivity research on percolation theory,[<a href=
      "node66.html#orr87">191</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#lobb87">158</a>] or the influence of the study
      of Josephson-junction arrays on the theory of two-dimensional
      phase transitions.[<a href="node66.html#nelson79">182</a>,<a
      href="node66.html#forrester88">88</a>] Despite the many
      aspects of superconductivity research in the '80's, though,
      one paradigm has been central throughout: the concept of
      anisotropic superconductivity. This theme has been manifested
      in all sorts of systems, from quasi-one-dimensional
      superconductors like the polymer SN<sub>x</sub>,[<a href=
      "node66.html#greene84">95</a>] to heavy-fermion
      superconductors with possibly anisotropic pair-states,[<a
      href="node66.html#stewart84">225</a>] to artificially layered
      superconducting superlattices which show a 3D-2D crossover in
      their critical fields.[<a href=
      "node66.html#ruggiero85">209</a>] The unexpected advent of
      high- T<sub>c</sub> materials is in harmony with the theme of
      anisotropic superconductivity since the oxide superconductors
      show orientation-dependent properties in many ways similar to
      those of the superconductors studied earlier in the
      decade.[<a href="node66.html#orlando87">188</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#worthington87">268</a>,<a href=

    </p>
    <p>
      The principal topic of this thesis is anisotropic
      superconductivity of graphite intercalation compounds
      (GIC's). Graphite intercalation compounds are superlattices
      formed by the chemical insertion into the graphite matrix of
      a species called the intercalant.[<a href=
      "node66.html#I94">67</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#whittingham82">1</a>] GIC's are called donor
      compounds if the intercalant gives electrons to the carbon
      layers, and acceptor compounds if the intercalant takes
      electrons from the carbon layers. None of the acceptor GIC's
      is known to be superconducting, despite the fact that many of
      them are metallic.[<a href="node66.html#I94">67</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#ericescy">64</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Superconducting GIC's do not have an exotic electron-pairing
      mechanism, do not show a 3D-2D crossover, and have no
      foreseeable technological applications. Yet there are many
      interesting questions about graphite-based superconductors
      which remain to be answered, especially with regard to their
      anisotropy. The most obvious of these questions concerns the
      very existence of superconductivity in the GIC
      C<sub>8</sub>K,[<a href="node66.html#hannay65">102</a>] a
      compound made from two constituents which are not separately
      superconducting. C<sub>8</sub>K is a binary GIC formed by the
      insertion of potassium atoms between the layers of graphite.
      The accepted structure of C<sub>8</sub>K is shown in Figure
      1.

      typical stage 1 intercalation compound. Stage n means that n
      layers of graphite are present between each pair of
      intercalant layers.[<a href="node66.html#I94">67</a>] a) The
      layer structure. The lattice constant along the direction
      perpendicular to the planes is called I<sub>c</sub> in GIC's.
      b) Three common in-plane structures. C<sub>8</sub>K has the
      (2 &times; 2)R0&deg; structure.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The superconductivity of C<sub>8</sub>K is still under
      investigation,[<a href="node66.html#aljishi88">5</a>] but in
      recent years attention has turned more to the ternary GIC
      superconductors, which have two intercalated components, an
      alkali metal (denoted M) and a heavy metal. The ternary GIC
      superconductors are highly anisotropic, with critical fields
      that vary by as much as a factor of 47 as a function of
      orientation.[<a href="node66.html#iye83a">121</a>] The binary
      GIC superconductors, on the other hand, have critical field
      anisotropies only on the order of 4.[<a href=
      "node66.html#koike80">141</a>] Despite an extensive study of
      the critical fields of the ternary GIC superconductors by Iye
      and Tanuma,[<a href="node66.html#iye82">120</a>] there are
      still some fundamental questions about the angular and
      temperature dependence of the critical fields to be answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike the binary GIC superconductors, the MHg-GIC's are
      synthesized from an intercalant, the MHg amalgam, which is in
      itself superconducting. The intercalation compounds formed
      from the MHg amalgams have higher superconducting transition
      temperatures than the amalgams themselves. In addition, the
      second-stage MHg-GIC's, which have two carbon layers between
      the graphite planes, have higher T<sub>c</sub>'s than the
      stage 1 GIC's, with one carbon layer between the graphite
      planes. These facts run counter to usual expectations based
      on proximity-effect theories,[<a href=
      "node66.html#werthamer63">261</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#cooper61">49</a>] which predict the monotonic
      depression of T<sub>c</sub> when a superconducting material
      is layered with a non-superconducting one like graphite.
      Therefore the ternary graphite-based superconductors display
      qualitatively different phenomena than the artificially
      structured superlattices, which do show behavior
      qualitatively in agreement with proximity theories.[<a href=
      "node66.html#ruggiero85">209</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The ternary GIC superconductors are in many respects similar
      to the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC's) and their
      intercalation compounds (TMDCIC's). The TMDC's are different
      from graphite in that they are by themselves superconducting,
      but alike in their divergence from the predictions of
      proximity-effect theories. Intercalation of the TMDC's with
      organic molecules increases their transition temperature
      T<sub>c</sub>,[<a href="node66.html#gamble70">92</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#prober80">200</a>] despite the fact that the
      proximity effect should cause the opposite behavior. In
      graphite-based superconductors, the T<sub>c</sub> of the
      intercalant is enhanced by intercalation, whereas in the
      TMDC-based superconductors, the T<sub>c</sub> of the host is
      enhanced by intercalation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enhancement of T<sub>c</sub> in the TMDCIC's that is
      associated with intercalation is attributed to the
      suppression of a charge-density wave (CDW) state.[<a href=
      "node66.html#murphy75">179</a>] Besides suppression through
      intercalation, CDW's in TMDC's can also be inhibited by
      hydrogen absorption[<a href="node66.html#murphy75">179</a>]
      and the application of small hydrostatic pressures.[<a href=
      "node66.html#monceau77">172</a>] Both hydrogen sorption and
      hydrostatic pressure in suppressing the CDW raise
      T<sub>c</sub> in the TMDC's. Application of a small pressure
      can also raise T<sub>c</sub> in the ternary GIC
      superconductor C<sub>4</sub>KHg.[<a href=
      "node66.html#delong83">55</a>] Recent experiments have also
      shown that hydrogen sorption increases the transition
      temperature of C<sub>4</sub>KHg.[<a href=
      "node66.html#H242">207</a>] These experiments in combination
      with other similarities between the TMDC's and GIC's suggest
      the possibility of a CDW in C<sub>4</sub>KHg.[<a href=
      "node66.html#delong83">55</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The fundamental questions in the field of GIC
      superconductivity are therefore the following: Why is
      C<sub>8</sub>K superconducting? Why do the MHg-GIC's have
      higher T<sub>c</sub>'s than their intercalants alone? Why do
      stage 2 MHg-GIC's have higher T<sub>c</sub>'s than the stage
      1? How can one account for the unusual angular and
      temperature dependence of the critical fields in GIC
      superconductors? and Why do hydrogenation and pressure
      dramatically increase the T<sub>c</sub> of C<sub>4</sub>KHg?
      Why aren't acceptor GIC's superconducting?
    </p>
    <p>
      These questions will be addressed in the chapters that
      follow. Chapter 2 is a discussion of non-GIC anisotropic
      superconductors and the ideas they give regarding the GIC
      experiments. Chapter 3 explains how the samples used in the
      new experiments were prepared, and discusses issues in GIC
      synthesis as they relate to superconductivity. Chapter 4, the
      heart of this work, is a report of detailed critical field
      studies on C<sub>4</sub>KHg, and an account of what these
      studies reveal about GIC superconductivity. Hydrogenation
      experiments on C<sub>4</sub>KHg and the possibility of a CDW
      suppression of T<sub>c</sub> are discussed in Chapter 5.
      Chapter 6 details attempts to find superconductivity in
      CsBi-GIC's, and Chapter 7 is a summary.

      <b>A Word about Notation:</b> In the GIC literature, it is
      customary to measure all orientation angles from the graphite
      c-axis. On the other hand, in the anisotropic
      superconductivity literature it is customary to measure all
      angles from the layer planes. The GIC convention has been
      adopted here, and all formulae taken from papers that used
      the other convention have been converted. Thus the direction
      called || in the superconductivity literature is now called
      _|_ c, and the direction called _|_ in the superconductivity
      literature is now called || c. While on the subject of
      confusion, it is worth mentioning that cgs units have been
      used throughout, the quantity N(0) is the density-of-states
      for both spin directions, and <b>e</b> is the electronic
      charge, a positive quantity.
