      The primary focus of this thesis has been to understand
      superconductivity in the KHg-GIC's. There are several aspects
      to the problem. One is to understand the stage-dependence of
      T<sub>c</sub>. As discussed in Section <a href=
      "node35.html#models"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      and <a href="node61.html#concl"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> , the increase of T<sub>c</sub> with increasing stage
      can be viewed as evidence of an important role for graphitic
      electrons in GIC superconductivity. If graphitic electrons
      also participate in superconductivity, then the apparent
      increase of T<sub>c</sub> with increasing stage in the
      KHg-GIC's is not so surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most unusual aspect of GIC superconductivity is the
      anisotropy of the upper critical field, H<sub>c2</sub>. This
      anisotropy can also be understood in terms of participation
      by graphitic electrons in the superconducting state.[<a href=
      "node66.html#M143">4</a>] H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>, T)
      data for C<sub>4</sub>KHg have been interpreted in terms of
      the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau model (AGL).[<a href=
      "node66.html#kats69">127</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#morris72">175</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#tilley65">244</a>] Quantitative agreement was
      found for gold specimens with T<sub>c</sub> about 0.8 K, in
      accord with the reports of Iye and Tanuma.[<a href=
      "node66.html#iye82">120</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      For pink specimens with T<sub>c</sub> about 1.5 K,
      corrections to the AGL model had to be included in order to
      achieve a good fit. The AGL H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)
      formula agreed well with the pink C<sub>4</sub>KHg data once
      allowance was made for type I superconductivity. Type I
      superconductivity occurs in a small temperature-dependent
      range of applied-field orientations near <i>vec</i>H || ^c.
      The occurrence of type I superconductivity in pink
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg is in accord with calculations based on the
      specific heat data of Alexander <em>et al.</em>[<a href=
      "node66.html#alexander81">8</a>] The values of the
      thermodynamic critical field H<sub>c</sub> obtained from fits
      to the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data imply a smaller
      density of states at E<sub>F</sub>, N(0), than that measured
      by Alexander.[<a href="node66.html#alexander81">8</a>] This
      discrepancy concerning the magnitude of N(0) could simply be
      due to demagnetization effects on the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) measurements, which could reduce
      the apparent value of H<sub>c</sub>. On the other hand, if
      the magnitude of N(0) obtained from the angular dependence
      data is correct, this smaller value could help to explain why
      T<sub>c</sub> is lower in C<sub>4</sub>KHg than in
      C<sub>8</sub>KHg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extended linearity of H<sub>c2</sub>(T) was also observed in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg. The temperature dependence of
      H<sub>c2</sub> in C<sub>4</sub>KHg (and in other
      superconducting GIC's[<a href=
      "node66.html#koike80">141</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#iye82">120</a>]) is reminiscent of critical
      field data on the layered TMDC's.[<a href=
      "node66.html#ikebe80">114</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#dalrymple84">51</a>] Because of the evidence
      that both intercalant and graphitic electrons participate in
      GIC superconductivity, multiband models of H<sub>c2</sub>
      would appear to be appropriate.[<a href=
      "node66.html#aljishi88">5</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#entel76">80</a>] The nearly cylindrical shape of
      the graphitic piece of a GIC's Fermi surface[<a href=
      "node66.html#I94">67</a>] suggests that anisotropic
      Fermi-surface models might also be good candidates to
      describe H<sub>c2</sub> of superconducting GIC's.[<a href=
      "node66.html#butler80">33</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#youngner80">274</a>] More quantitative
      information about the Fermi surface of the GIC's is necessary
      before these models can be tested, although some calculations
      are available.[<a href="node66.html#holzwarth88">112</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink and gold C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimens were found to differ
      in their superconducting transition temperature and critical
      field behavior, as mentioned above. The only detectable
      distinction in the normal-state properties of these compounds
      is that the gold specimens often (and perhaps always) contain
      some of the higher- I<sub>c</sub> <i>beta</i> phase. The pink
      samples, on the other hand, are composed solely of the lower-
      I<sub>c</sub> <i>alpha</i> phase. The relative amounts of the
      two phases can be controlled, within limits, by fine-tuning
      the intercalation conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The depression of T<sub>c</sub> by a small fraction of the
      minority <i>beta</i> phase is unusual. In general, only
      magnetic impurities are so potent in lowering
      T<sub>c</sub>.[<a href="node66.html#tinkham80">252</a>]
      Surprisingly, adding a small amount of hydrogen or applying a
      minute hydrostatic pressure[<a href=
      "node66.html#delong83">55</a>] restores T<sub>c</sub> to
      about 1.5 K. A T<sub>c</sub> enhancement by hydrogenation and
      applied pressure is also seen in several of the transition
      metal dichalcogenides.[<a href="node66.html#friend79">90</a>]
      These TMDC's support charge-density waves,[<a href=
      "node66.html#wilson75">265</a>] so the increase of
      T<sub>c</sub> with the application of a small perturbation is
      attributed to the suppression of the CDW state.[<a href=
      "node66.html#friend79">90</a>] The suppression of a CDW by
      hydrogen and applied pressure also seems reasonable in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg.[<a href="node66.html#delong83">55</a>] The
      similarity of the Fermi surfaces of the TMDC's and
      superconducting GIC's lends additional credence to the CDW
      hypothesis.[<a href="node66.html#inoshita77">115</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The highly variable range of T<sub>c</sub> in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg is matched by the CsBi-GIC's. For
      C<sub>4</sub>CsBi<sub>0.5</sub>, T<sub>c</sub> has been
      reported to be as high as 4 K,[<a href=
      "node66.html#mcrae85">168</a>] while other investigators[<a
      href="node66.html#E291">36</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#stang88">223</a>] have found no
      superconductivity down to 50 mK. Extensive efforts to
      reproduce the higher T<sub>c</sub> value have been
      unsuccessful.[<a href="node66.html#lagrange85a">144</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The apparent lack of superconductivity in the CsBi-GIC's is
      puzzling considering that the alloy CsBi<sub>2</sub> is
      superconducting with T<sub>c</sub> = 4.75 K.[<a href=
      "node66.html#mcrae85">168</a>] The high resistivity
      anisotropy of the MBi-GIC's (M = a heavy alkali metal) may
      offer an important clue. McRae <em>et al.</em>[<a href=
      "node66.html#mcrae88">166</a>] note that
      <i>rho</i><sub>c</sub> / <i>rho</i><sub>a</sub> is much
      higher in the MBi-GIC's than in other donor compounds. They
      interpret their MBi-GIC c-axis resistivity data in terms of
      the hopping conduction mechanism proposed by Sugihara.[<a
      href="node66.html#E343">229</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#M325">230</a>] Perhaps c-axis band conduction in
      <b>s</b>-like intercalant states is necessary for the
      existence of superconductivity in GIC's. Similar ideas have
      been discussed by Al-Jishi.[<a href="node66.html#M143">4</a>]
      In light of the hypothetical CDW state in C<sub>4</sub>KHg,
      the possibility of a CDW should also be taken seriously for
      the MBi-GIC's.
    </p>
    <p>
      These considerations may also apply to the acceptor GIC's,
      which also tend to have hopping conduction along the
      c-axis.[<a href="node66.html#mcrae88">166</a>] The acceptor
      GIC's are discussed in more detail below.
