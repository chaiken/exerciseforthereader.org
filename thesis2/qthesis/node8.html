    <p>
      Anisotropy effects are fundamental to superconductivity. This
      is true because any non-cubic material that can be grown with
      sufficient structural perfection should show some anisotropy
      in its superconductivity. Even cubic materials can show
      deviation from isotropic models of superconductivity if they
      have non-spherical Fermi surfaces.[<a href=
      "node66.html#butler80">33</a>] Thus, as pointed out by
      Dalrymple,[<a href="node66.html#dalrymple83">50</a>] just
      about all crystalline superconductors are in principle
      expected to show some anisotropy effects. Clearly these
      effects are more important in some materials than in others,
      and the materials at the high-anisotropy end of the continuum
      are more interesting for comparison with GIC's.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the weakly anisotropic end of the continuum are bulk
      transition metals like Nb, V, and Tc. These materials are
      three-dimensional anisotropic superconductors characterized
      by different superconducting coherence lengths in different
      crystallographic directions. The Pippard coherence length
      <i>xi</i><sub>0</sub>, is defined to be the approximate
      spatial extent of the Cooper pairs. From an
      uncertainty-principle-type argument by Pippard,[<a href=
      "node66.html#tinkham80">252</a>] this extent must be
      approximately <i>hbar</i>/<i>Delta</i>p = <i>hbar</i>
      v<sub>F</sub> / k<sub>B</sub> T<sub>c</sub>. This
      relationship shows the connection between the Fermi surface
      and superconductivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity (discussed
      further in Sections 4.1 and 4.5) a more generalized coherence
      length <i>xi</i> is defined. This Ginzburg-Landau coherence
      length is related to the upper critical field for a bulk type
      II superconductor by
    </p>
    <p>
      <img width="500" height="43" src="xidef.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      where &oslash;<sub>0</sub> is the superconducting flux
      quantum.[<a href="node66.html#tinkham80">252</a>] An
      angle-dependent coherence length therefore gives an
      anisotropic critical field. When a superconductor has
      uniaxial symmetry, two of its three pricipal coherence
      lengths are the same. (In the most general case, all three
      coherence lengths may be different.) Then the angular
      dependence of H<sub>c2</sub> is given by the simple
      expression:[<a href="node66.html#kats69">127</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#morris72">175</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="ldtheor" name="ldtheor">&nbsp;</a><img width="500"
      height="45" align="bottom" alt="" src="mcbeqn.png" /> (2)
    </p>
    <p>
      where <i>epsilon</i> is the critical field anisotropy
      parameter of Morris, Coleman and Bhandari,[<a href=
      "node66.html#morris72">175</a>], defined by:<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <img width="200" height="26" src="epsdef.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Except for this angular dependence of H<sub>c2</sub>, these
      weakly anisotropic superconductors behave for the most part
      like isotropic type II superconductors. For example, the
      temperature dependence of their critical fields is given by
      the usual Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg-Maki theory.[<a href=
      "node66.html#degennes66">54</a>] This theory gives a linear
      temperature dependence near T<sub>c</sub> and saturation at
      lower temperatures. Linear behavior of H<sub>c2</sub> implies
      because of Eqn. 1 that <i>xi</i> goes as (1 -
      t)<sup>-1/2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides bulk anisotropic superconductors like some of the
      transition metals, there is another familiar class of
      materials with anisotropic superconducting properties. This
      is the class of superconducting thin films, which were the
      first anisotropic superconductors to be studied.[<a href=
      "node66.html#tinkham63">250</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#burger65">32</a>] When the thickness of a film
      is less than the coherence length, the Cooper pairs can only
      interact with their neighbors in the plane of the film. In
      this case, the film is commonly referred to as a
      two-dimensional superconductor because the Cooper pairs only
      interact in two directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As might be expected, the lowering of the effective
      dimensionality of a superconductor from three to two
      dimensions has important and measurable consequences. These
      consequences stem from the fact that the length scale for
      superconductivity in the direction perpendicular to the film
      is now the film thickness rather than the coherence length.
      Most of the expressions that describe thin-film
      superconductors can be derived simply by replacing one of the
      coherence lengths in Eqn. 1 by the film thickness, plus some
      numerical factors. For example, consider the critical fields
      of a thin film. When the external field is applied along the
      perpendicular to the film, Eqn. 1 still holds. However, for a
      field applied in the plane of the film, the critical field
      for a thin film is now H<sub>c2, _|_ ^c</sub> =
      <i>sqrt</i>3&oslash;<sub>0</sub> / <i>pi</i> <i>xi</i> d,
      where d is the film thickness.[<a href=
      "node66.html#tinkham80">252</a>] From the (1 -
      t)<sup>-1/2</sup> temperature dependence of <i>xi</i> given
      above, one can immediately see that H<sub>c2, _|_ c</sub>
      will have a square-root temperature dependence:
      H<sub>c2</sub> proportional to (1 - t)<sup>1/2</sup>.[<a
      href="node66.html#tinkham63">250</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#harper68">104</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The square-root temperature dependence is one of the
      hallmarks of two-dimensional superconductivity. The other is
      an angular dependence of the critical field given by
      Tinkham's formula:[<a href="node66.html#tinkham63">250</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      <img width="489" height="51" src="tinkham.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      where H<sub>c2</sub>(0&deg;) = H<sub>c2, || c</sub> and
      H<sub>c2</sub>(90&deg;) = H<sub>c2, _|_ c</sub>. The angle
      <i>theta</i> is defined in Figure 4.6. The square-root
      temperature dependence and Tinkham's formula for the angular
      dependence have been observed many times in thin films. What
      is more surprising is that these two-dimensional properties
      have also been observed in bulk superconductors which have a
      layered structure. Rigorous calculations for a multilayer
      structure composed of superconducting and insulating planes
      have been performed by Klemm, Luther and Beasley.[<a href=
      "node66.html#klemm75">131</a>] The KLB calculations show that
      a dimensionality crossover is expected to occur at a finite
      temperature when the parameter <b>r</b> is less than 1.7,[<a
      href="node66.html#klemm75">131</a>] where <b>r</b> is defined
      by
    </p>
    <p>
      <img width="379" height="50" src="rparam.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The temperature at which the decoupling of the
      superconducting planes occurs occurs is called T<sup>*</sup>.
      T<sup>*</sup> is approximately defined by <i>xi</i><sub>||
      c</sub>(T<sup>*</sup>) = d. Usually layered superconductors
      show 3D anistropic superconductivity like the bulk transition
      metals, but sometimes they show 2D superconductivity like
      thin films, and sometimes they even show entirely new
      effects. Below, the portion of the work on the upper critical
      fields of layered superconductors which is most relevant to
      the GIC experiments is briefly reviewed.
