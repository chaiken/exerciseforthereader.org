      When a full set of critical field data was desired on a
      sample, its zero-field transition was first obtained to make
      sure that the particular specimen was in fact
      superconducting. Then the sample was cooled to the lowest
      obtainable temperature, usually about 0.44 K, at which a
      series of field sweeps was performed as a function of the
      angle between the sample c-axis and the applied field. The
      definition of this angle, hereinafter called <i>theta</i>, is
      illustrated in Figure <a href="node27.html#hc2def"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> a. The samples were
      mounted with their a-axis vertical, and the field of the
      magnet was parallel to the ground, so that the rotation was
      accomplished by turning the probe by hand about its vertical
      axis. The relative amount of rotation was determined by
      fixing a pointer to the probe and noting its angular
      displacement with respect to a metal compass bolted onto the
      <sup>4</sup>He cryostat. Orientation readings made in this
      fashion were thought to be reproducible to about &plusmn;
      1&deg;, an estimate based on the scatter in the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) curves. The exact direction
      corresponding to the samples' c-axis could not be determined
      <em>a priori</em> and so was found by a fit to the angular
      dependence after the data were entered into a computer at a
      later date. The approximate orientation of the _|_ ^c and ||
      ^c directions was estimated at runtime by visual inspection
      of the data, and this information was used for the
      measurement of the temperature dependence of H<sub>c2</sub>
      at constant orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a complete angular dependence of H<sub>c2</sub> had
      been measured at the lowest obtainable temperature, the
      sample was rotated until the applied field was aligned
      parallel to the carbon (graphene) planes. This alignment was
      not perfect for several reasons. The first reason is the
      inaccuracy in the <i>theta</i> reading. Secondly, the
      specimens' a-axis may not have been exactly vertical due to
      small inaccuracy in sample mounting. The misalignment angle
      between the carbon (graphene) planes and the vertical will be
      called &oslash; to distinguish it from <i>theta</i>, the
      angle in a horizontal plane between the graphite c-axis and
      the applied magnetic field. (The angle &oslash; is defined
      pictorially in Figure <a href="node29.html#misalign"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .) Misalignment due to
      this cause is estimated to be at most 5&deg;, and probably
      less. A third cause of imperfect alignment is that the carbon
      (graphene) planes of the C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimens used in
      these measurements are not exactly flat due to imperfect
      alignment of the c-axis of the graphite host. The amount of
      misalignment of the c-axis is called the mosaic spread. Also,
      a small amount of exfoliation (non-uniform spreading of the
      graphite layers) tends to occur during intercalation. Rocking
      curves taken using elastic neutron (00<i>l</i>) scans (see
      Chapter <a href="node12.html#samprep"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ) showed the mosaic
      spread of a few C<sub>4</sub>KHg HOPG samples to be 2&deg; to
      3&deg;. Some of the HOPG-based GIC's likely had larger mosaic
      spreads. Mosaic spreads as large as 8 or 9 degrees are not
      uncommon after intercalation in ternary and metal-chloride
      compounds.[<a href="node66.html#speck88"></a>] The flattest
      samples from a given batch were always chosen for the
      critical field measurements, but nonetheless effects due to
      sample warping could not be completely eliminated. Overall
      inaccuracy due to all these causes could perhaps have been as
      much as 7&deg;, and is estimated to have averaged about
      3&deg; in practice. Because these alignment and flatness
      problems tend to reduce the observed value of
      H<sub>c2_|_^c</sub>, the anisotropy values quoted in this
      work should be thought of as representing lower bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the applied field parallel to the carbon (graphene)
      planes, a series of field sweeps at increasing temperatures
      was taken to determine H<sub>c2_|_^c</sub>(T). The
      temperature was stabilized during these sweeps by rapid
      adjustment of the various valves in the pumping system. The
      temperature range in which the sample could be stabilized
      during the time necessary to complete the field sweep was
      about &plusmn; 3%, according to the thermometer. Of course,
      the GIC's temperature varied more slowly than the
      thermometer's due to its insulation from the bath by its
      encapsulation tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the temperature series with <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c was
      completed, a similar series with <i>vec</i>H || ^c was
      similarly performed. These measurements were much less
      sensitive to misalignment, but were susceptible (because of
      the smaller size of H<sub>c2|| ^c</sub>) to electrical noise
      that generated stray fields. When the two temperature series
      were finished, two more sets of H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)
      at constant temperature data could be collected: one at 1.2
      K, which corresponds to the lowest obtainable temperature of
      the <sup>4</sup>He bath with a roughing pump; and one set at
      0.9 K, which corresponds to the lowest <sup>4</sup>He
      temperature obtainable by using a booster pump in addition.
      Reliable H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data sets could not be
      obtained at other temperatures because of the impossibility
      of stabilizing the temperature for the necessary period of
      time (2 to 3 hours) without an electronic feedback system.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a full set of data had been obtained, it was analyzed
      graphically. H<sub>c2</sub> was defined as the intersection
      of a line drawn tangent to the transition with the level
      upper portion of the sweep, the same definition as was used
      in Ref. [<a href="node66.html#iye82">120</a>]. The
      application of this criterion for H<sub>c2</sub> is
      illustrated in Figure <a href="node27.html#hc2def"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> b. Other definitions of
      H<sub>c2</sub> were tried in analyzing the data; while they
      slightly changed the results quantitatively, they had no
      effect on the <em>shape</em> of any of the curves described
      here. (See Figure <a href="node29.html#ninetytangent"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> for a demonstration of
      this.) The possibility of bias introduced in the data
      analysis is discussed further in Section <a href=
      "node29.html#extrinsic"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      The data were then typed in by hand to a VAX 11/750 computer
      and fit by the appropriate formulae.
    </p>
    <p>
      Electrical noise was not a problem in the critical field
      determination since the signal-to-noise ratio for the field
      sweeps was about 1000. However, the width and shape of the
      transitions changed drastically as the angle <i>theta</i> was
      varied. This lack of constancy in the shape of the transition
      made a consistent definition of the upper critical field a
      tricky matter. The different shapes of the transition are
      illustrated in Figure <a href="node27.html#transwidth"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. The change in breadth
      of the superconducting transition with angle is common to
      polycrystalline layered superconductors[<a href=
      "node66.html#prober80">200</a>], and is due to the
      contribution of misaligned grains as <i>theta</i> is varied.
      Misaligned grains have almost no effect on the field sweep
      when <i>vec</i>H is applied parallel to the c-axis, but will
      contribute noticeably when <i>vec</i>H is applied in the
      layer planes, perpendicular to the c-axis. The reason for
      this behavior comes from the form of
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>), which is strongly peaked near
      <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c. In essence, near the || ^c orientation,
      since H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) is fairly flat, slightly
      misoriented grains have almost the same critical field as the
      bulk of the sample. On the other hand, near the _|_ ^c
      orientation, where H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) is strongly
      angle-dependent, slightly misoriented grains have much lower
      critical fields than the bulk, and thus contribute to the
      foot of the transition, making it appear much broader than it
      would in a perfect crystal.
    </p>
    <p>
      To some extent, the greater breadth of the <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c
      transition may be an intrinsic effect. The reason is that the
      anisotropy of H<sub>c1</sub> in a superconductor described by
      the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory is expected to be
      approximately the reciprocal of the H<sub>c2</sub>
      anisotropy.[<a href="node66.html#lawrence71">155</a>] That
      is, theoretically H<sub>c1</sub> should be lower in the
      direction where H<sub>c2</sub> is higher, so that the
      transition should be broader in the high- H<sub>c2</sub>
      direction. It is not clear whether the H<sub>c1</sub>
      anisotropy is also contributing to the orientation dependence
      of the transition width.

      There are several ways in which the critical field
      experiments described in this chapter could have been
      improved. Firstly, a servo-controlled gearing system for
      rotating the sample would probably reduce the errors in the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) measurements, and would
      certainly make these measurements easier to perform. Probes
      were available that have gearing systems for rotating the
      sample around a horizontal axis, but not for rotating the
      sample about a vertical axis, as was necessary in this
      experiment. Secondly, an electronic temperature controller
      would have made it possible to obtain
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) scans at much more closely
      spaced intervals below T<sub>c</sub>, and thus would have
      allowed taking many points in an anisotropy versus
      temperature curve. Thirdly, performing the data collection
      with a computer rather than a chart recorder would greatly
      reduce the labor involved in reducing the data, and also
      would allow more sophisticated real-time data analysis.
      Lastly, if a more powerful x-ray apparatus were available for
      doing diffraction on samples in glass tubes, it would be
      possible to measure the mosaic spread of the crystals
      directly. This measurement would eliminate some of the
      uncertainty in the fitting of H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)
      described in the next section. All in all, it is expected
      that improvement of the instrumentation would have a real
      impact on the H<sub>c2</sub>(T) experiment, but would not
      affect the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data much because of
      the limitations due to crystalline quality and misalignment.
