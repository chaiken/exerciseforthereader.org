      The hydrogen--doped stage 1 KHg--GIC's were prepared in a
      two--step process, analogous with the preparation of
      C<sub>8</sub>KH<sub>x</sub>.[<a href=
      "node66.html#lagrange78">152</a>] First, several batches of
      stage 1 KHg--GIC's were prepared by the usual two--zone
      method, as described in Section <a href=
      "node14.html#synth"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      These specimens where characterized by (00<i>l</i>) x-ray
      diffraction and their zero-field superconducting transition
      was measured, as described in Section <a href=
      "node20.html#zerof"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      Raman scattering spectra were also recorded on some samples,
      as described in Section <a href="node17.html#ramdata"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to perform the hydrogen doping, the same samples
      that were characterized without hydrogen were transferred
      under a vacuum of about 10<sup>-5</sup> torr to a new
      ampoule. Hydrogen gas was purified through diffusion through
      a Pd-Ag tube inside a Resource Systems Model RSD-1 hydrogen
      purifier. (200&plusmn;2) torr of this gas was admitted to the
      sample tube through a glass break-seal. After about 5 minutes
      of exposure, 200 torr of He gas was also bled into the tube
      for thermal contact during the low-temperature measurements.
      The sample tube was then sealed off from the vacuum system
      with a gas torch.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the hydrogen had been admitted to the sample tube, the
      pressure of the gas was monitored using a Setra Model 300D
      capacitive manometer, although in the early experiments a
      mercury-column manometer was used. No change in hydrogen
      pressure was determined within experimental error; that is,
      the time rate of change of pressure was about the same
      whether or not the glass tube contained a KHg-GIC sample.
      Thus the any slight change in the pressure during exposure is
      attributed to thermal drift of the sensor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apparently small hydrogen uptake of the HOPG-based
      KHg-GIC's is consistent with the very slow hydrogen sorption
      that occurs in HOPG-based K-GIC's.[<a href=
      "node66.html#guerard83">97</a>] For example, the
      C<sub>8</sub>KH<sub>0.19</sub> specimens used in the
      superconductivity studies of Kaneiwa <em>et al.</em> were
      reacted with hydrogen gas for 105 days.[<a href=
      "node66.html#kaneiwa82">125</a>] The slow speed of hydrogen
      diffusion into HOPG-based GIC's is attributed to the low
      defect density of HOPG. If C<sub>4</sub>KHg has more defects
      than C<sub>8</sub>K, it might absorb hydrogen more quickly.
      Nonetheless, the hydrogen uptake of C<sub>4</sub>KHg must be
      quite small.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be interesting to try longer hydrogen exposure times
      or higher hydrogen pressures to see if more hydrogen is
      absorbed. High hydrogen pressures were avoided in these
      experiments for safety reasons, but experiments with higher
      hydrogen pressures are planned at the Tokyo Institute of
      Technology in the near future.[<a href=
      "node66.html#enoki88">77</a>] Hydrogen exposure times longer
      than 5 minutes were not used because of fear that air leaks
      into the apparatus could degrade the sample quality. Samples
      attached to the vacuum system without hydrogen gas addition
      tend to begin to lose their surface luster after about 5
      minutes. Making KHg-GIC's out of a less-ordered host material
      (such as Grafoil) might also permit larger hydrogen
      absorption.[<a href="node66.html#guerard83">97</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the fact that bulk absorption of hydrogen must be
      quite small, the effect of hydrogen on the C<sub>4</sub>KHg
      samples was easily visible. Isothermally prepared GIC's,
      which were initially pink, became blue during hydrogen
      exposure, and then turned a dark violet. Gold GIC's became
      blue--violet indefinitely afterward. The samples' color did
      not change noticeably after a period of about 12 hours. A
      C<sub>8</sub>KHg sample exposed to hydrogen showed no color
      change at all. These color changes may well occur only on the
      surface, and so should not be taken too seriously. As
      discussed in Section <a href="node16.html#xrd"><img width=
      "13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> , post-hydrogenation
      (00<i>l</i> ) scans showed that the samples' repeat distances
      were unchanged upon hydrogen doping. No change in the lattice
      constant was anticipated due to the small amount of hydrogen
      that was absorbed. Hydrogen absorption also seemed to have
      little impact on the Raman spectrum. However, the effect of
      hydrogenation on the superconductivity was more dramatic, as
      will be described in the next section.
