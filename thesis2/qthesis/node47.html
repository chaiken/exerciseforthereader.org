      T<sub>c</sub> measurements on KHg are summarized in Table <a
      href="node47.html#hydtctable"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> . The hydrogenation had very little effect on the
      superconductivity of pink specimens, which initially had a
      narrow transition and T<sub>c</sub> 1.5 K. The transition of
      a pink C<sub>4</sub>KHg sample before and after hydrogenation
      is shown in Figure <a href="node47.html#hydeffect"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>b). On the other hand,
      hydrogenation had two major effects on the gold samples. The
      first effect was to narrow the superconducting transition,
      decreasing <i>Delta</i> T<sub>c</sub>/ T<sub>c</sub> by as
      much as a factor of two. In addition, T<sub>c</sub> in the
      hydrogenated gold samples was about 1.5 K, just as in the
      pink specimens. Superconducting transitions before and after
      hydrogenation for a gold sample are shown in Figure <a href=
      "node47.html#hydeffect"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      a). The effect of hydrogen on a specimen with an initially
      broad transition but a fairly high T<sub>c</sub> is shown in
      Figure <a href="node47.html#hydeffect"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>c). Notice that the 3
      transitions before hydrogenation are quite different from one
      another, whereas afterward the three all have T<sub>c</sub>
      1.5 K and <i>Delta</i> T<sub>c</sub>/ T<sub>c</sub> on the
      order of 10<sup>-2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A valid question about these experiments is whether a small
      fraction of the sample volume might account for the changes
      seen in the superconducting transition. This concern is
      especially important because the inductive measurements are
      sensitive to a transition in as little as 2% of the typical
      sample volume (see Section <a href=
      "node26.html#electronics"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      ). Also, the small size of the hydrogen uptake might lead one
      to suspect that only a tiny portion of the sample was
      hydrogenated. Because of the sensitivity of the transition
      height to the sample's position within the secondary coil,
      and the lack of information about the sample's exact
      dimensions after intercalation, it is not possible to say
      with any certainty what the actual areal fraction of
      superconductivity before and after hydrogenation is. However,
      the superconducting transitions measured both before and
      after hydrogenation were always at least 2 <i>mu</i>V high, a
      considerable fraction of the 5 <i>mu</i>V expected for the
      typical sample cross-sectional area. (See the discussion of
      Figure <a href="node26.html#scingfract"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> for more details.) Most
      of the transitions were on the order of 4 to 8 <i>mu</i>V
      high. The T<sub>c</sub>'s quoted in Table <a href=
      "node47.html#hydtctable"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      can be said with certainty to correspond to at least 40% of
      the areal fraction, and probably they represent true bulk
      superconductivity. Therefore the hydrogen-induced
      T<sub>c</sub> enhancement in C<sub>4</sub>KHg is undoubtedly
      a bulk effect.

       <strong>Figure:</strong> Superconducting transitions before
      and after hydrogenation in three types of C<sub>4</sub>KHg
      samples. a) A gold sample. T<sub>c</sub> increases from 0.88
      K to 1.54 K, and <i>Delta</i> T<sub>c</sub>/ T<sub>c</sub>
      decreases from 7.3&times; 10<sup>-2</sup> to 7.8&times;
      10<sup>-2</sup>. b) A pink sample. T<sub>c</sub> is almost
      constant; <i>Delta</i> T<sub>c</sub>/ T<sub>c</sub> decreases
      from 4.7&times; 10<sup>-2</sup> to 2.2&times;
      10<sup>-2</sup>. c) A copper-colored sample. T<sub>c</sub>
      increase from 1.32 K to 1.50 K; <i>Delta</i> T<sub>c</sub>/
      T<sub>c</sub> decreases from 0.138 to 6.47&times;
      10<sup>-2</sup>.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Another issue related to sample homogeneity is the question
      of multiple superconducting transitions. It is reasonable to
      ask whether the hydrogenated T<sub>c</sub> = 1.54 K specimen
      (whose transition appears in Figure <a href=
      "node47.html#hydeffect"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      a)) did not still have a transition at 0.88 K, its
      pre-hydrogenation T<sub>c</sub>. The answer is no, within the
      limits of the sensitivity of the apparatus. A second,
      lower-temperature transition was always checked for and never
      found in samples whose T<sub>c</sub> was increased by
      hydrogenation. The lack of a second transition is additional
      evidence that hydrogen increased the bulk T<sub>c</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A related hypothesis is that the transition narrowing is
      merely due to suppression of the superconductivity of the
      lower- T<sub>c</sub> phase. This assertion cannot be correct
      since T<sub>c</sub> enhancement was also seen in GIC's with
      initially narrow transitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the slow kinetics of hydrogen uptake in HOPG-based
      GIC's, one might wonder whether T<sub>c</sub> would increase
      above 1.5 K through further hydrogen additions. As is shown
      in Table <a href="node47.html#hydtctable"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>, a second 5-minute
      hydrogen exposure had almost no effect on T<sub>c</sub> or
      <i>Delta</i> T<sub>c</sub>/ T<sub>c</sub>. As another check
      of time-dependent effects, the superconducting transition of
      one hydrogenated GIC was remeasured after a wait of one year.
      The T<sub>c</sub> increased only from 1.52 K to 1.54 K, which
      is within the experimental uncertainty. The (00<i>l</i>)
      x-rays also did not show any change over this period.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to get more clues about the origin of the
      T<sub>c</sub> enhancement, one copper-colored
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg was exposed to deuterium rather than
      hydrogen. Deuterium appears to have the same effect as
      hydrogen, as is shown in Table <a href=
      "node47.html#hydtctable"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>.
      The lack of any isotope effect associated with the
      hydrogenation suggests that the T<sub>c</sub> enhancement is
      not due to optic phonons, the mechanism responsible for the
      T<sub>c</sub> enhancement in the transition metals.[<a href=
      "node66.html#economou81">68</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Table <a href="node47.html#hydtctable"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> also shows that one
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimen showed only a small T<sub>c</sub>
      increase as a result of hydrogenation, from 0.72 K to 0.94 K.
      The reason why the final T<sub>c</sub> of this sample was not
      1.5 K is not known. The fact that this sample had the lowest
      T<sub>c</sub> of any of the measured samples suggests that it
      may have been too disordered to improve substantially upon
      hydrogenation. Or alternatively, the hydrogen uptake rate in
      this specimen may have been especially slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In light of the results on C<sub>4</sub>KHg, the apparent
      decrease of T<sub>c</sub> in C<sub>8</sub>KHg by hydrogen
      addition is quite surprising. It would be a mistake to make
      very much of this result since hydrogen was added to only one
      stage 2 sample. The hydrogenation of C<sub>8</sub>KHg
      deserves further investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data in Table <a href="node47.html#hydtctable"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> tend to underline the
      differences between the pink and gold C<sub>4</sub>KHg GIC's
      that were summarized in Table <a href=
      "node41.html#pinkgold"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      These experiments show that adding hydrogen to a gold sample
      seems to change its superconducting properties into those of
      a pink sample. Hydrogenation of a sample with a broad
      transition seems to turn the lower- T<sub>c</sub> material
      that forms the foot of the transition into T<sub>c</sub> =
      1.5 K material. Hydrogen appear to have no effect on regions
      that initially have T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K. The striking
      aspect of these results is thus not that hydrogen raises
      T<sub>c</sub> but that hydrogen appears to be transforming
      one type of C<sub>4</sub>KHg into another since the end state
      appears to be always the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      By what means does hydrogen transform the lower-
      T<sub>c</sub> material into T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K material?
      And what is the essential difference between the lower and
      higher- T<sub>c</sub> material? The next section contains
      some speculative attempts at answers to these questions.
