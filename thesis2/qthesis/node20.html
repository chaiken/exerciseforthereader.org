      The preparation for the zero-field T<sub>c</sub> measurements
      was as follows. After a batch of KHg-GIC's was removed from
      the furnace in its intercalation ampoule, the individual
      GIC's were transferred inside an inert-gas-filled glovebox to
      4mm Pyrex tubes. When the specimens were intended for
      critical field studies, they were mounted in special sample
      holders before placement in the glass tubes (see Section <a
      href="node25.html#mounting"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> ). Once the specimens were inside the glass tubes, the
      tubes were attached to a stopcock via a Cajon quick-connect
      vacuum fitting. They were then taken out of the glovebox and
      attached to a pumping station, where they could be evacuated
      to pressures on the order of 10<sup>-5</sup> torr with a
      diffusion pump. Once the ampoules were evacuated, they were
      filled with about 200 torr of He gas which had been passed
      through a liquid-nitrogen cold trap to remove water. This gas
      was intended to provide thermal contact of the sample to the
      glass tube, thus making the cryogenic temperature
      measurements more accurate. The He-filled tubes were then
      sealed off with a gas/oxygen torch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the GIC's were in individual tubes, they were
      characterized for staging fidelity with (00<i>l</i>) x-rays
      (see Section <a href="node16.html#xrd"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>). Those that were
      well-staged and uniform in color were taken to the National
      Magnet Laboratory for zero-field T<sub>c</sub> and critical
      field measurements. The zero-field T<sub>c</sub> measurements
      were performed using the same cryogenics, electronics, and
      thermometry that were employed in the critical field studies.
      This apparatus is described in Section <a href=
      "node24.html#critfexp"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
    </p>
    <p>
      T<sub>c</sub> was determined by measuring the voltage from an
      inductance bridge as a function of temperature from 4.2 K
      down to 0.4 K. For materials in which a higher T<sub>c</sub>
      than 4.2 K seemed plausible, higher temperatures were
      achieved by bleeding warm He gas into the liquid helium
      cryostat. The transition was easily recognized as a large
      reproducible decrease in the inductive voltage.
      Signal-to-noise ratios of 1000 were not uncommon.
    </p>
    <p>
      T<sub>c</sub> was defined to be the intersection of a line
      drawn tangent to the most linear part of the transition with
      the level upper part of the transition. This definition,
      which is a standard one for inductive measurements,[<a href=
      "node66.html#iye82">120</a>] is illustrated by Figure <a
      href="node20.html#tcdef"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      The transition width, <i>Delta</i> T<sub>c</sub>, was defined
      as the interval between the 10% and 90% completion
      temperatures of the transitions. The dimensionless figure of
      merit used to characterize sample quality is <i>Delta</i>
      T<sub>c</sub>/T<sub>c</sub>. This ratio is a
      T<sub>c</sub>-independent measure of how narrow a specimen's
      superconducting transition is. <i>Delta</i> T<sub>c</sub>/
      T<sub>c</sub> ranged from about 0.2 for poorly ordered
      samples to about 10<sup>-2</sup> for well-ordered specimens.

       <strong>Figure:</strong> Experimental definition of
      T<sub>c</sub>.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      T<sub>c</sub> and <i>Delta</i> T<sub>c</sub>/T<sub>c</sub>
      are reported for a number of samples in Table <a href=
      "node20.html#tcfreq"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      <i>Delta</i> T<sub>c</sub>/T<sub>c</sub> mostly increases
      with decreasing T<sub>c</sub>, which suggests that the low-
      T<sub>c</sub> GIC's are less homogeneous than the higher-
      T<sub>c</sub> ones. The observation of broader transitions in
      lower- T<sub>c</sub> samples is in keeping with the idea that
      the lower- T<sub>c</sub> specimens contain both the
      <i>alpha</i> and <i>beta</i> phases, while the higher-
      T<sub>c</sub> specimens contain only the <i>alpha</i> phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the <i>beta</i> phase is responsible for T<sub>c</sub>
      suppression in C<sub>4</sub>KHg, one might expect that
      samples might sometimes have two separate superconducting
      transitions, the first at 1.5 K and a second at 0.8 K. Yet
      two separate transitions have never been observed in a
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg sample, although very broad transitions have
      sometimes been seen. An interpretation for the lack of two
      transitions is suggested by the TEM work performed by Timp[<a
      href="node66.html#K167">246</a>]. The TEM micrographs
      consistently showed that the in-plane phases were intermixed
      on a microscopic scale. If the regions of <i>beta</i> phase
      are small and are surrounded by <i>alpha</i>-phase, they may
      well be proximity-coupled to the <i>alpha</i>-phase regions.
      Proximity coupling between the lower- and higher-
      T<sub>c</sub> regions of the specimen can give a single
      transition, just as is observed. Caution is necessary when
      discussing the intermixture of phases, though, since a
      high-enough degree of admixture along the c-axis would give
      broadened (00<i>l</i>) x-ray lineshapes.[<a href=
      "node66.html#hendricks42">109</a>] As the spectra in Section
      <a href="node16.html#xrd"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      show, these broadened lineshapes have not been observed.

    <p>
      A sceptic might claim that the color of the C<sub>4</sub>KHg
      samples is a property only of the surface layers, and is not
      really linked to the superconductivity. This is not an
      unreasonable idea since the (<i>sqrt</i>3 &times;
      <i>sqrt</i>3)R30&deg; superlattice has been tentatively
      identified as a surface phase in Section <a href=
      "node17.html#ramdata"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      However, the gold color is strongly correlated with the
      presence of the <i>beta</i> phase in the (00<i>l</i>) x-rays.
      Furthermore, the color is as good a predictor of
      T<sub>c</sub> as the x-rays are, as Table <a href=
      "node20.html#tcfreq"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      shows. Lagrange and coworkers have also reported the
      existence of the gold color in association with the
      <i>beta</i> phase.[<a href="node66.html#lagrange83">147</a>]
      They report that repeated cleaving of a ``gold'' sample will
      expose both pink and gold surfaces in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these considerations and the evidence in Table <a href=
      "node20.html#tcfreq"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      it is clear that gold samples have lower T<sub>c</sub>'s than
      pink ones. Furthermore, this T<sub>c</sub> depression seems
      to be linked to the presence of the <i>beta</i> phase. The
      possible effect of the two phases of C<sub>4</sub>KHg on
      superconductivity measurements is discussed further in
      Chapter <a href="node40.html#hydrog"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> . The differences in the
      critical fields of the two types of C<sub>4</sub>KHg are
      detailed in Chapter <a href="node22.html#critf"><img width=
      "13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
