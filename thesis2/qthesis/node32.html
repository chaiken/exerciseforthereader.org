      Another peculiarity of the C<sub>4</sub>KHg
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) curves is that they are well-fit
      by Tinkham's H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) formula for thin
      films:[<a href="node66.html#tinkham63">250</a>]<br />

      The Tinkham formula fit is decent (<i>cal</i> R = 0.83 at t =
      0.29 for a T<sub>c</sub> = 1.54 K sample) even without
      allowing for type I behavior, and is quite good (<i>cal</i> R
      = 0.26) if type I behavior is taken into account. A summary
      of the residuals for fits to the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)
      data is given in Table <a href="node32.html#residsum"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>, and a direct comparison
      between the two types of fits is shown in Figure <a href=

      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      a). Figure <a href="node32.html#TINKvsAGL"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>b) shows the errors of
      the two fits as a function of the angle <i>theta</i>. For the
      T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K GIC's the Tinkham formula fits have
      residuals about half of those of the best AGL fits.
      Consultation of standard tables on statistics[<a href=
      "node66.html#bevington69">21</a>] shows that (for 39 degrees
      of freedom and a 3-parameter fit, the conditions of Figure <a
      href="node32.html#TINKvsAGL"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> ) there is about an 80% probability that the Tinkham
      formula is a better description of the data than the AGL
      model. The data on the lower- T<sub>c</sub> samples are still
      best fit by the plain two-parameter AGL theory, just as was
      reported by Iye and Tanuma.[<a href=
      "node66.html#iye82">120</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason that a good fit to Eqn. <a href=
      "node32.html#tinkham"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      is unexpected is that its derivation requires the assumption
      that the superconducting order parameter doesn't vary along
      the direction perpendicular to the specimen's surface.[<a
      href="node66.html#tinkham63">250</a>] This assumption seems
      reasonable for a film which has a thickness less than a
      superconducting coherence length, but is hard to believe when
      the sample is 10<sup>5</sup> coherence lengths in thickness.
      Only if the sample were so disordered along the c-axis that
      its structural coherence length was on the order of the
      superconducting coherence length could one envision that the
      Tinkham formula should apply. However, the metallic nature of
      the c-axis conductivity[<a href=
      "node66.html#fischer83">85</a>] and the reproducibility of
      the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) results from one sample to
      another argue strongly against this interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tinkham's formula has been used to fit
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) curves in the artificially
      structured superlattice superconductors, such as Nb/Cu[<a
      href="node66.html#chun84">42</a>] and Nb/Ta[<a href=
      "node66.html#broussard88">29</a>]. However in these systems
      Eqn. <a href="node32.html#tinkham"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> fits only below the
      3D-2D crossover point (see Chapter <a href=
      "node7.html#othersys"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      ), and C<sub>4</sub>KHg is clearly well into the 3D regime,
      where Eqn. <a href="node28.html#ldtheor"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> is supposed to be
      applicable. The 3D nature of superconductivity in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg is unquestionable because the
      Klemm-Luther-Beasley <b>r</b>-parameter is about 2000 at 0 K,
      while 1 is the critical value for the dimensionality
      crossover.[<a href="node66.html#klemm75">131</a>] (The
      question of dimensionality crossover as it relates to GIC's
      is discussed further in Sections <a href=

      Despite the statistically significant improvement that
      Tinkham's formula gives over the AGL Eqn. <a href=
      "node28.html#ldtheor"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      it is quite hard to justify the use of Tinkham's formula
      theoretically. One obvious possibility is that the
      superconductivity measured in C<sub>4</sub>KHg is not a bulk
      phenomenon, but is merely due to a thin layer on the surface.
      The idea is not that there is surface-nucleated
      superconductivity at the edge of a homogeneous bulk
      superconductor, but that there could be a second
      crystallographic phase stable only near the surface. This
      explanation is appealing because it would help explain the
      mystery as to the difference between the gold and pink phases
      of C<sub>4</sub>KHg : the gold lower- T<sub>c</sub> phase
      which is well-fit by Eqn. <a href="node28.html#ldtheor"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> would be due to bulk
      superconductivity, whereas the pink higher- T<sub>c</sub>
      phase would be present only on the surface. A surface phase
      present only in a thin layer could easily mimic
      two-dimensional behavior, and would be expected to fit
      Tinkham's formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      Superconductivity in a surface layer has already been shown
      to give good agreement with Tinkham's formula. In lead films
      doped with thallium, the ``thin film'' was a
      surface-nucleated layer about a coherence length thick.[<a
      href="node66.html#tinkham64">251</a>] Nonetheless the
      ``film'' had critical fields which agreed quite well with the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) shape predicted by Eqn. <a href=
      "node32.html#tinkham"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      Surface superconductivity cannot be responsible for the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) behavior here since it can give
      only the anisotropy ratio 1.69 = H<sub>c3</sub>/
      H<sub>c2</sub>.[<a href="node66.html#tinkham64">251</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one major problem with the idea of the pink (
      T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K) phase of C<sub>4</sub>KHg being
      present only as a surface film. That problem is that if thin
      films are responsible for the angular dependence of
      H<sub>c2</sub>, they should give[<a href=
      "node66.html#tinkham80">252</a>]<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <img align="bottom" alt="" src="img70.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      where d is the thickness of the film. As discussed in Section
      <a href="node8.html#otherintro"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> , thin films have a parallel critical field with a
      temperature dependence of the form H<sub>c2, _|_ ^c</sub>
      <i>propto</i> (1 - t)<sup>1/2</sup>, a form which is in
      definite conflict with the linear behavior found for
      H<sub>c2, _|_ ^c</sub>(t). (The temperature dependence of
      H<sub>c2</sub> at constant angle is discussed in detail in
      the Section <a href="node34.html#hvstdata"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .)
    </p>
    <p>
      For a given anisotropy, the primary difference between
      Tinkham's formula and Eqn. <a href="node28.html#ldtheor"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> is that the Tinkham's
      formula curve has upward positive curvature for all angles,
      whereas the AGL angular dependence has an inflection point in
      the wings of the peak, and has negative curvature at
      <i>theta</i> = 90&deg;. The challenge in justifying the
      application of Tinkham's formula to GIC's is to think of a
      factor that could cause H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) to rise
      more steeply than the AGL dependence. One aspect of the
      problem that is completely overlooked in the derivation of
      Eqn. <a href="node28.html#ldtheor"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> (and in the derivation
      of Tinkham's formula, for that matter) is the microscopic
      physics of the flux-line lattice (FLL). In an isotropic
      superconductor, in the absence of defects, the axis of
      symmetry of a vortex must lie along the applied field. If the
      symmetry axis of the vortex were not along the applied field,
      the screening currents in the vortex would have to be larger,
      which would cost kinetic energy. Tilley,[<a href=
      "node66.html#tilley65">244</a>] one of the originators of the
      AGL model, calculated the properties of the flux-line lattice
      (FLL) in anisotropic superconductors. He found that the
      energy of the FLL is lowest when the applied field is along a
      crystallographic symmetry direction. When the applied field
      is at an arbitrary angle <i>theta</i> with respect to the
      symmetry axes, the vortices pay a potential energy price for
      their misorientation with respect to the crystalline axes.[<a
      href="node66.html#tilley65">244</a>] Perhaps when the applied
      field is oriented only slightly off a crystallographic
      symmetry direction (such as <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c), the
      flux-line lattice might actually minimize its total energy
      (kinetic energy from screening currents plus potential energy
      of misorientation) by orienting the vortices' symmetry axes
      along the crystallographic symmetry direction rather than
      along the applied field. Quantitative calculations by
      Kogan[<a href="node66.html#kogan81">138</a>] and Kogan and
      Clem[<a href="node66.html#kogan81a">139</a>] suggest that
      this rotation of the flux-line lattice may be a common
      feature of anisotropic superconductors. It is proposed that
      rotation of the FLL to the crystallographic symmetry
      direction for <i>theta</i> near 90&deg; could help explain
      why the experimental data rise more sharply than the AGL
      model in the wings of the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) peak.
      Unfortunately, coming up with a test of this hypothesis is
      not easy. Magnetic torque measurements might be able to give
      some information.[<a href="node66.html#hagen87">100</a>]
      Kogan and Clem suggest neutron scattering and nuclear
      magnetic resonance tests.[<a href=
      "node66.html#kogan81a">139</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, Tinkham's formula provides the best fit to the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data for the T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5
      K specimens. However, the assumptions used in the derivation
      of the Tinkham formula[<a href=
      "node66.html#tinkham63">250</a>] imply a temperature
      dependence of H<sub>c2</sub> which is strongly in conflict
      with experimental data. Therefore, solving the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) problems of the C<sub>4</sub>KHg
      data with Tinkham's formula creates new problems for
      H<sub>c2</sub>(t). Figure <a href=
      "node32.html#TINKvsAGL"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      b) shows that the Tinkham's formula fit seems to be an
      improvement on the AGL theory principally in the wings, where
      the angular dependence of the demagnetization may play a
      role. Therefore an unsatisfying but reasonable conclusion is
      that the agreement with Tinkham's formula is fortuitous,
      implying that the formula somehow mimics the combination of
      anisotropy, tilt, type I behavior, demagnetization effects
      and mosaic spread that were actually present in the
      experiments. Alternatively, the microscopic details of the
      flux-line lattice may be having an effect on
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>).
