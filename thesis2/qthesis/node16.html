    <p>
      The most common method for staging determination in GIC's is
      (00<i>l</i>) x-ray diffraction.[<a href=
      "node66.html#I94">67</a>] This technique was also applied to
      the KHg- and CsBi-GIC's, although more for determination of
      the phase (<i>alpha</i> and/or <i>beta</i>) than for
      identification of stage. Mixed-stage KHg or CsBi specimens
      were never at any time produced in the course of this study,
      although a given stage might contain the admixture of several
      different phases. The lack of stage admixture is not
      surprising for C<sub>4</sub>KHg, which is formed from the
      intercalation of K and Hg vapor into C<sub>8</sub>K,[<a href=
      "node66.html#A157">82</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#elmakrini80">70</a>] but is somewhat surprising
      for the stage I C<sub>4</sub>CsBi<sub>0.5</sub> and
      C<sub>4</sub>CsBi<sub>1.0</sub>, which are formed from higher
      stage CsBi-GIC's.[<a href="node66.html#bendriss86b">18</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of the peaks of only one phase in a (00<i>l</i>)
      diffraction was the most common occurrence. However, gold
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples sometimes contained the
      I<sub>c</sub> = 10.83 &Aring; <i>beta</i> minority phase as
      well as the I<sub>c</sub> = 10.24 &Aring; <i>alpha</i>
      majority phase. The x-rays scans of many gold samples
      contained only the majority-phase peaks, though. Kim <em>et
      al.</em> note that their experiments indicate that use of a
      small temperature difference <i>Delta</i>T increases the
      amount of <i>beta</i>-phase. This finding which is consistent
      with Table 3.2, which shows that gold samples are typically
      intercalated with a small <i>Delta</i>T. Predominantly
      <i>beta</i>-phase specimens are never produced.[<a href=
      "node66.html#lagrange83">147</a>] Occasionally C<sub>8</sub>K
      ( I<sub>c</sub> = 5.35 &Aring;) was also observed in the
      diffraction scans of gold-colored stage I. Samples which
      contained C<sub>8</sub>K were never used in further
      experiments, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasional presence of C<sub>8</sub>K in gold but not
      pink samples is intriguing in light of the hypotheses
      presented in Section 3.2 about the synthesis of the different
      types of C<sub>4</sub>KHg. One of the ideas put forward in
      Section 3.2 to explain the occurrence of gold samples was
      that they were the product of an incomplete intercalation
      reaction. As mentioned above, C<sub>4</sub>KHg is formed from
      the intercalation of K and Hg vapor into C<sub>8</sub>K,
      which forms first.[<a href="node66.html#timp83">249</a>,<a
      href="node66.html#elmakrini80">70</a>] If the gold samples
      are the result of an incomplete reaction, one would expect to
      see C<sub>8</sub>K peaks in gold specimens, but not in the
      completely reacted pink specimens. As noted above, this is
      exactly what is observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The (00<i>l</i>) scans shown here were taken using molybdenum
      K<sub><i>alpha</i></sub> radiation with a wavelength of 0.708
      &Aring;. Molybdenum radiation was chosen because it passes
      relatively unattenuated through the glass tubes in which the
      samples were encapsulated. The radiation from the Mo anode
      passed through a 1.0&deg; horizontal collimation slit on its
      way to the GIC, and a ``High-Resolution'' Soller slit and
      0.1&deg; vertical collimation slit on its way to the
      detector, which was of the extrinsic silicon type. The
      diffractometer used is part of the Center for Materials
      Science X-Ray Facility at MIT, and is of standard design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typical (00<i>l</i>) scans for C<sub>4</sub>KHg pink (
      T<sub>c</sub> = 1.53 K) and gold ( T<sub>c</sub> = 0.95 K)
      specimens are shown in Figure 3.3. These plots show intensity
      versus the angle 2<i>theta</i> between the incident and
      diffracted beams. The diffractograms for both the pink and
      gold samples show peaks from the copper sample holders used
      for the low-temperature measurements (discussed in Section
      4.3) near 2<i>theta</i> = 22&deg; and broad humps from the
      glass tube that surrounds the sample from about 6&deg; to
      about 14&deg;. These scans are quite similar to those shown
      by Timp[<a href="node66.html#timp83">249</a>] and Lagrange
      <em>et al.</em>[<a href="node66.html#lagrange80b">149</a>].
      The magnitude of I<sub>c</sub> was estimated from using
      Bragg's Law using the separation between the most intense
      pair of peaks, the (002) and (004). The average value of
      I<sub>c</sub> obtained in these measurements, 10.20 &Aring; ,
      is in accord with the (10.12 &plusmn; 0.03) &Aring; found by
      Timp[<a href="node66.html#timp83">249</a>], the 10.24 &Aring;
      found by Univ. of Kentucky researchers,[<a href=
      "node66.html#yang88">270</a>] and the 10.16 &Aring; reported
      by Lagrange.[<a href="node66.html#lagrange80">150</a>]
      However, Lagrange shows the intensity of the (004) peak
      higher than the intensity of the (002), contrary to Ref. [<a
      href="node66.html#timp83">249</a>] and Figure 3.3. This
      reversal of the usual intensity ratios was seen for some of
      the samples used in this study, but it appeared that the
      effect was due to improper centering of the specimen on the
      goniometer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Figure 3.3: (00<i>l</i>) x-ray scans for pink and gold
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg. The large peak near 22&deg; in each scan is
      from the copper sample holder. The broad hump from about
      6&deg; to 14&deg; is due to the glass tube that the sample
      holder is in. a) I<sub>c</sub> = (10.22 &plusmn; 0.03)
      &Aring; pink sample. T<sub>c</sub> = 1.53 K. b) I<sub>c</sub>
      = (10.18 &plusmn; 0.03) &Aring; gold sample. T<sub>c</sub> =
      0.95 K.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      (00<i>l</i>) x-ray diffraction was also performed before and
      after hydrogenation on both pink and gold specimens.
      Hydrogenation appeared not to affect I<sub>c</sub>, as Figure
      <a href="node16.html#hydxrd"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> shows. The scan after hydrogenation has a larger (004)
      peak than (002), while the scan before hydrogenation has a
      larger (002) peak. As noted before, this reversal appears to
      be an alignment-dependent effect. Other diffraction data
      taken after hydrogenation data on this sample show the (002)
      peak higher. There does not seem to be any reproducible
      difference between the (00<i>l</i>) patterns before and after
      hydrogenation.
    </p>

      <br />
       <strong>Figure 3.4:</strong> (00<i>l</i>) x-ray scans before
      and after hydrogenation for a gold C<sub>4</sub>KHg sample.
      The broad hump from about 6&deg; to 14&deg; is due to the
      glass tube that the sample is in. Before: T<sub>c</sub> =
      0.84 K gold C<sub>4</sub>KHg sample. I<sub>c</sub> = (10.24
      &plusmn; 0.03) &Aring;. After: Same sample as in ``Before''
      picture, only after exposure to 200 torr hydrogen gas.
      T<sub>c</sub> = 1.535 K. I<sub>c</sub> = (10.24 &plusmn;
      0.03) &Aring;.
    </p>
    <p>
      (00<i>l</i>) scans for two CsBi-GIC's are shown in Figure
      3.5. a) shows the x-rays of a C<sub>4</sub>CsBi<sub>0.5</sub>
      <i>alpha</i>-phase specimen with I<sub>c</sub> = 10.61
      &Aring;, and b) shows a similar scan taken by
      Bendriss-Rerhrhaye.[<a href="node66.html#bendriss86">17</a>]
      These scans look different because the spectrum of Bendriss
      is taken with <i>theta</i> increasing from right to left, and
      the MIT spectrum is taken with 2<i>theta</i> increasing from
      left to right. <i>alpha</i> + <i>beta</i>-phase specimens
      were also synthesized which had an additional set of peaks
      corresponding to I<sub>c</sub> = 11.43 &Aring;. The MIT
      values for I<sub>c</sub> compare favorably with the (10.61
      &plusmn; 0.02) &Aring; for <i>alpha</i>-phase and (11.48
      &plusmn; 0.02) &Aring; for <i>beta</i>-phase reported by
      McRae <em>et al.</em>[<a href="node66.html#mcrae86">167</a>]
      There is not any obvious difference between the two sets of
      (00<i>l</i>)'s despite the fact that T<sub>c</sub> = 4.05 K
      is reported for the University of Nancy samples and
      T<sub>c</sub> <b>&lt;</b> 0.5 K for the MIT specimens. (There
      are more details about the superconductivity of CsBi-GIC's in
      Chapter 6.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Figure 3.5:</strong> (00<i>l</i>) x-ray scans for
      <i>alpha</i>-phase stage 1 CsBi-GIC's. The broad hump from
      about 6&deg; to 14&deg; is due to the glass tube that the
      sample holder is in. a) I<sub>c</sub> = (10.61 &plusmn; 0.03)
      &Aring; <i>alpha</i>-phase sample. b) Similar (00<i>l</i>)
      scan taken by Bendriss-Rerhrhaye.[<a href=
      "node66.html#bendriss86">17</a>] In b), <i>theta</i> is
      increasing from right to left, whereas in a) 2<i>theta</i> is
      increasing from left to right.
    </p>
    <p>
      In both the case of the KHg-GIC's and the CsBi-GIC's, the
      (00<i>l</i>) scans show essentially no difference between
      low- T<sub>c</sub> and high- T<sub>c</sub> samples. In an
      attempt to find some structural information that would
      correlate with T<sub>c</sub>, Raman scattering experiments
      were performed. The results of these experiments are
      described in the next section.
