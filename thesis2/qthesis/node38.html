      There are two-types of models which take anisotropy as a
      point of departure, rather than treating it as a small
      perturbation, as the pioneering Hohenberg and Werthamer model
      did.[<a href="node66.html#hohenberg67">111</a>] One class
      consists of models that consider a single non-spherical Fermi
      surface and/or energy gap. This category includes work by
      Takanaka,[<a href="node66.html#takanaka75">238</a>] Pohl and
      Teichler,[<a href="node66.html#pohl76">195</a>] Youngner and
      Klemm,[<a href="node66.html#youngner80">274</a>] Butler,[<a
      href="node66.html#butler80">33</a>] and Prohammer and
      Schachinger.[<a href="node66.html#prohammer87">201</a>] The
      other class of theories study the implications of two
      different Fermi surface pieces that contribute to
      superconductivity. These models have been developed by Entel
      and Peter,[<a href="node66.html#entel76">80</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#entel77">81</a>] Decroux,[<a href=
      "node66.html#decroux80">52</a>], and Al-Jishi[<a href=
      "node66.html#M143">4</a>].
    </p>
    <p>
      Theories in the first class, consisting of the anisotropic
      gap/Fermi surface models, are essentially extensions of the
      AGL model discussed previously. That is, these theories
      contain the essential physics of the AGL model plus
      modifications describing what are called non-local effects.
      ``Non-local'' is an adjective that refers to clean-limit
      phenomena outside the the scope of Ginzburg-Landau theories
      which are related to the finite spatial extent of the Cooper
      pair.[<a href="node66.html#tinkham80">252</a>] That the more
      complex models reduce to the AGL model in the local limit is
      demonstrated by Hohenberg and Werthamer.[<a href=
      "node66.html#hohenberg67">111</a>] What Hohenberg and
      Werthamer did was to rewrite the eigenvalue equation for the
      energy gap (which is an intermediate step in the derivation
      of the Helfand-Werthamer equation for H<sub>c2</sub>) in
      terms of an infinite sum. The sum has terms which are matrix
      elements of even powers of a quantity proportional to
      <i>vec</i>v <i>cdot</i> <i>vec</i><i>pi</i>, where
      <i>vec</i>v is the Fermi velocity and <i>vec</i><i>pi</i> ==
      <i>hbar</i>/i <i>vec</i><i>nabla</i> - e/c <i>vec</i>A is the
      gauge-invariant momentum operator. Because of the
      relationship between the vector potential <i>vec</i>A and the
      magnetic field, it turns out that the component of
      <i>vec</i>v parallel to <i>vec</i><i>pi</i> is orthogonal to
      the applied field, in keeping with the expectation from the
      GL theory that transport in a plane perpendicular to the
      applied field determines H<sub>c2</sub>. The important
      quantity in this formalism is
    </p>
    <p>
      <img align="bottom" alt="" src="img101.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      where the integral is to be taken over the FS. Here
      <i>vec</i>q is a point on the Fermi surface, N(<i>vec</i>q)
      is the density of states at that point, and v<sub>_|_
      ^H</sub> (<i>vec</i>q) is the component of
      <i>vec</i>v<sub>F</sub>(<i>vec</i>q) perpendicular to
      <i>vec</i>H. Obviously the critical field anisotropy is
      uniquely specified by one parameter <i>epsilon</i> only if
      the FS is ellipsoidal. Otherwise knowledge of the entire FS
      geometry is needed. Notice that v<sub>_|_ <i>vec</i>H</sub>
      (<i>vec</i>q) depends not only on the magnitude of
      <i>vec</i>v<sub>F</sub> at the point <i>vec</i>q, but also on
      the angle between the angle between <i>vec</i>H and
      <i>vec</i>v<sub>F</sub>(<i>vec</i>q). This point is
      illustrated by Fig. <a href="node38.html#perpexplain"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> from Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#dalrymple83">50</a>].

       <strong>Figure:</strong> Illustration of how v<sub>_|_
      <i>vec</i>H</sub> (<i>vec</i>q) changes as a function of
      wavevector <i>vec</i>q for an ellipsoidal Fermi surface.
      <i>vec</i>q is the coordinate of a point on the Fermi
      surface. B is Dalrymple's anisotropy parameter, which is
      equivalent to <i>epsilon</i> in the AGL model.[<a href=
      "node66.html#dalrymple83">50</a>]<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Hohenberg and Werthamer went on to show that keeping only the
      zeroth-order term in the infinite sum gives the isotropic
      theory, while keeping terms up to the second order in the dot
      product gives the AGL model, including Eqn. <a href=
      "node28.html#ldtheor"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      for H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>).[<a href=
      "node66.html#decroux82">53</a>] What all subsequent models of
      FS/gap anisotropy do is to include more terms in the sum over
      powers of ( <i>vec</i>v <i>cdot</i> <i>vec</i><i>pi</i>).
      Increasingly higher-order terms correspond both to higher
      degrees of non-locality, and because of symmetry, also to
      more complex FS/gap geometries ( <em>i.e.,</em> higher
      angular momentum spherical harmonics). Hohenberg and
      Werthamer included fourth-order contributions
      perturbatively,[<a href="node66.html#hohenberg67">111</a>]
      which corresponds to the weak-anisotropy limit. The
      weak-anisotropy limit is probably less appropriate for GIC's
      than for superconductors like niobium or vanadium, which have
      1/<i>epsilon</i> on the order of 2 or 3. The Hohenberg and
      Werthamer model only modifies H<sub>c2</sub>(t) near
      T<sub>c</sub>, and cannot produce the low-t enhancement
      observed in GIC's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Takanaka included terms up to order four in a
      non-perturbative manner, but his theory is limited to t 1
      because of an error.[<a href=
      "node66.html#youngner80">274</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#ikebe80">114</a>] Youngner and Klemm, who fit
      their equations to NbSe<sub>2</sub> data, found a way to sum
      the series exactly up to infinite order.[<a href=
      "node66.html#youngner80">274</a>] They remark that their
      model is basically equivalent to that of Pohl and Teichler,
      who fit data on vanadium.[<a href=
      "node66.html#pohl76">195</a>] These models are also very
      similar to the work of Butler,[<a href=
      "node66.html#butler80">33</a>] who applied his theory to
      niobium, except that Butler dropped all terms due to gap
      anisotropy in his final equations because he thought were
      quite small. Butler's equations have also been used by
      Dalrymple and Prober[<a href=
      "node66.html#dalrymple84">51</a>] to fit data on
      Nb<sub>1-x</sub>Ta<sub>x</sub>Se<sub>2</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From examination of the h<sup>*</sup> versus t curves that
      appear in either Butler's paper[<a href=
      "node66.html#butler80">33</a>] or Youngner and Klemm's
      paper,[<a href="node66.html#youngner80">274</a>] it is clear
      that either one can produce both extended linearity using an
      ellipsoidal Fermi surface model. This is encouraging because
      the <i>pi</i>-bands of GIC's are generally believed to
      produce an ellipsoidal FS piece,[<a href=
      "node66.html#I94">67</a>] but it is not the whole story. A
      calculation using Butler's equations taken from Dalrymple's
      thesis[<a href="node66.html#dalrymple83">50</a>] is shown in
      Fig. <a href="node38.html#butlerellipse"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> . Notice that
      h<sup>*</sup>(t) is enhanced only when Dalrymple's parameter
      B (which is the same for an ellipsoidal Fermi surface as
      <i>epsilon</i> from the AGL model) is less than one, and that
      h<sup>*</sup>(0) is actually suppressed from the isotropic
      value when B is greater than one. The significance of this
      conclusion is that for a simple ellipsoidal FS, the Butler
      model extended linearity gives only for one field
      orientation.[<a href="node66.html#dalrymple83">50</a>]
      Therefore one cannot describe critical field enhancement for
      both field orientations using a simple ellipsoidal FS.

      Taken from Ref. [<a href="node66.html#dalrymple83">50</a>].
      Dalrymple's parameter B is equivalent to 1/<i>epsilon</i> in
      the AGL model. The B = 1.0 curve is for a spherical Fermi
      Surface, and so is equivalent to the WHH theory.<br />

    <p>
      Because Dalrymple and Prober observed enhanced critical
      fields for NbSe<sub>2</sub> for both <i>vec</i>H || ^c and
      <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c,[<a href="node66.html#dalrymple84">51</a>]
      they tried fitting their data with more complex Fermi surface
      geometries. When they combined an ellipsoid with a
      cylindrical FS model calculated by Wexler and Woolley[<a
      href="node66.html#wexler76">263</a>], they found excellent
      quantitative agreement between theory and experiment for
      <i>vec</i>H || ^c, and good qualitative agreement for
      <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c.[<a href="node66.html#dalrymple83">50</a>]
      These fits are shown in Fig. <a href=
      "node38.html#nbse2fit"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      In order to get quantitative agreement for <i>vec</i>H _|_
      ^c, the authors had to multiply all the data through by a
      factor of 2.1. Dalrymple and Prober explained that this
      factor was necessary because of mean-free-path anisotropy,
      which is not taken into account in the Butler model. The
      mean-free path <i>l</i> comes in because of the dependence of
      H<sub>c2</sub> on the diffusivity D == 1/3 v<sub>F</sub>
      <i>l</i>. This type of mean-free-path anisotropy is quite
      believable since much larger ratios have often been seen in
      GIC's.[<a href="node66.html#mcrae88">166</a>] Essentially
      Dalrymple and Prober find that the Butler model describes
      H<sub>c2, || ^c</sub> data without correction. This agreement
      occurs since in-plane transport in NbSe<sub>2</sub> is clean,
      and Butler's model is for clean-limit superconductors. The
      Butler model needs a correction to fit H<sub>c2, _|_ ^c</sub>
      data because transport along ^c is dirty.

      thesis.[<a href="node66.html#dalrymple83">50</a>] a)
      H<sub>c2, _|_</sub> = H<sub>c2, || ^c</sub>. An excellent fit
      is obtained by using the Wexler-Woolley Fermi Surface
      model[<a href="node66.html#wexler76">263</a>] plus an
      additional ellipsoid. b) H<sub>c2, ||</sub> = H<sub>c2, _|_
      ^c</sub>. The Wexler-Woolley-plus-ellipsoid model produces
      the correct shape, but needs to be multiplied by an
      additional factor of 2.1 to account for mean-free-path
      anisotropy.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Youngner and Klemm's model of H<sub>c2</sub>(T) seems to be
      the same as Butler's, but with the added feature of gap
      anisotropy.[<a href="node66.html#youngner80">274</a>] In this
      case, <i>vec</i>v(<i>vec</i>q) <i>cdot</i>
      <i>vec</i><i>pi</i> may still depend on <i>vec</i>q. In
      addition, though, the states between which the matrix element
      of <i>vec</i>v <i>cdot</i> <i>vec</i><i>pi</i> is evaluated
      may also themselves be non-spherical. Youngner's model
      produces curves quite similar to those of Butler, including
      extended linearity and positive curvature for some choices of
      parameters. The recent theory of Prohammer and Schachinger[<a
      href="node66.html#prohammer87">201</a>] is nearly the same as
      Youngner and Klemm's model, only these authors consider
      electron-phonon coupling anisotropy rather than explicit gap
      anisotropy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if these weren't already enough models, there are also
      theories which consider the effect of multiple bands
      contributing to superconductivity. The most extensive of
      these was developed by Entel and Peter.[<a href=
      "node66.html#entel76">80</a>] A two-band model fit by Entel
      and Peter to data on
      Cs<sub>0.1</sub>WO<sub>2.9</sub>F<sub>0.1</sub>, a tungsten
      fluoroxide bronze, is shown in Fig. <a href=
      "node38.html#entelfit"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      Decroux and Fischer advocate the use of the Entel-Peter model
      for fits to ternary molybdenum chalcogenide data.[<a href=
      "node66.html#decroux82">53</a>] The main parameters which
      determine the critical field enhancement in this theory are
      the interband and intraband scattering times. Al-Jishi[<a
      href="node66.html#M143">4</a>] has proposed a theory quite
      similar to Entel and Peter's, but his critical field
      calculations are still in a preliminary phase. In GIC terms,
      these models propose that intercalant and graphitic bands
      both contribute to superconductivity. This idea was
      originally suggested by Al-Jishi,[<a href=
      "node66.html#M143">4</a>] and it is supported by a large
      amount of experimental evidence, as is described in Section
      <a href="node58.html#csbidisc"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />

       <strong>Figure:</strong> Two-band model fit to anomalous

      Helfand-Werthamer isotropic theory. The crosses, circles and
      squares are experimental data for three different
      crystallographic orientations (the orientations are not

      interband-scattering, whereas (2) and (3) correspond to
      increasing interband-scattering. The parameters of these fits
      are too numerous to list here, but may be found in Ref. [<a
      href="node66.html#entel77">81</a>].<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The profusion of models which predict an enhanced
      H<sub>c2</sub>(T) is quite confusing, especially since both
      the multiband and anisotropic gap/FS theories seem to have
      features which are very sensible for GIC's. Prohammer and
      Schachinger say in their recent paper[<a href=
      "node66.html#prohammer87">201</a>] that the Entel-Peter model
      and the anisotropic gap/FS models are actually equivalent,
      really amounting to different parameterizations of the same
      phenomena. Considering the similarities of the curves in
      Figs. <a href="node38.html#nbse2fit"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> and <a href=
      "node38.html#entelfit"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      this is not too surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of whether these models will explain the
      anomalies in GIC H<sub>c2</sub>(T) data, ranging from the
      extended linearity of C<sub>4</sub>KHg to the positive
      curvature of C<sub>8</sub>RbHg, still has not been directly
      addressed. Clearly all of the multiband and anisotropic
      gap/FS theories are capable of producing curves of the right
      shape, but this doesn't mean that they would give good fits
      to the data using reasonable FS/gap parameters.
      Unfortunately, no complete theoretical Fermi surface
      computation for the ternary GIC's is available, and there is
      only limited knowledge about the normal-state transport
      properties. Holzwarth[<a href=
      "node66.html#holzwarth88">112</a>] has calculated the band
      structure of C<sub>4</sub>KHg, but published only a
      qualitative sketch of the Fermi surface. This sketch is
      reproduced in Fig. <a href="node38.html#holzfs"><img width=
      "13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> . If Holzwarth publishes
      quantitative information about the FS of C<sub>4</sub>KHg,
      or, even better, FS information for C<sub>8</sub>RbHg, then a
      fit could be made to the critical field data. Obviously this
      hypothetical fit would be the decisive test of the
      applicability of these models.

      along k<sub>z</sub> than in the layer planes. The hexagonal
      solid line is the Brillouin zone; the roughly triangular
      pieces drawn with a solid line at the corners of the BZ are
      the graphitic <i>pi</i> bands. The pieces drawn with a dotted
      line are due to mercury bands. The small circular zone-center
      part is from Hg 6<b>s</b> holes; the hexagonal portion is
      from Hg 6p<i>pi</i> electron carriers; and the trigonal
      pieces at the zone corner are derived from H 6p<i>sigma</i>
      bands.<br />

      Lamentably an attempt to invert the critical field data to
      predict the geometry of the Fermi surface is not justified by
      the critical field data which is available. In principle at
      least, if H<sub>c2</sub>(T) had been measured at a large
      number of angles <i>theta</i>, this inversion could be
      performed.

      What conclusions can be drawn about the appropriateness of
      the anisotropic gap/FS or multiband models for GIC's in the
      absence of a fit? On the plus side, these models contain
      features compatible with what is already known about GIC's:
      GIC's have highly anisotropic Fermi surfaces; they are more
      disordered along the c-axis than in-plane; they have multiple
      bands present at the Fermi surface; and their
      h<sup>*</sup>(t) curves are much like those of the transition
      metal dichalcogenides for whom most of the models were
      intended. Therefore the tentative conclusion is that GIC
      superconductivity is described by one of these theories,
      although for positive confirmation, fits to the data are
      still needed.
