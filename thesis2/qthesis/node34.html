      Many of the experimental factors relevant to the angular
      behavior of the critical field will also complicate the
      temperature dependence. Among these are sample misalignment,
      mosaic spread, and critical field definition. In addition
      there are the considerations of temperature measurement,
      stability, and equilibration. (See Section <a href=
      "node26.html#electronics"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      .) Nonetheless, the H<sub>c2</sub>(T) results are a bit
      easier to interpret than the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)
      ones, if only because the functional form of the data is
      simpler. The approximately linear behavior of the temperature
      dependence curves is illustrated in Figure <a href=
      "node34.html#hc2temp"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      which shows H<sub>c2</sub>(T) curves for four different
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg GIC's. These data are from the same samples
      whose H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) curves are shown in Figure

      The quality-of-fit parameter <i>cal</i> R is calculated as in

      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>, only here the error at

    <p>
      <img align="bottom" alt="" src="img73.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the errors should really be smaller in magnitude
      than the data, but their fractional size is thought to be
      roughly independent of temperature, the independent variable.
      Letting the estimated error be the same as the data is a
      convenient way of implementing this standard assumption,
      which is called statistical weighting.[<a href=
      "node66.html#bevington69">21</a>] The field error bars shown
      on the plot are twice the mean error per data point in total
      length, where the mean error <i>sigma</i> is given by<br />

      where <i>nu</i> is the number of degrees of freedom. This is
      a standard way of defining error bars[<a href=
      "node66.html#pugh66">202</a>] which includes the effects only
      of random errors, not systematic ones. The temperature error
      bars are based on an uncertainty of 40 mK at the low end, and
      10 mK at the high end, for reasons discussed in Section <a

      to C<sub>4</sub>KHg H<sub>c2</sub>(T) data. The individual
      specimens are labeled by the value of T<sub>c</sub> obtained
      from the zero-field sweeps. The other parameters, including
      the ``fit'' T<sub>c</sub>, are obtained from the
      least-squares linear fits to the critical field data that are
      shown in Figure <a href="node34.html#hc2temp"><img width="13"

      In general, the data in Figure <a href=
      "node34.html#hc2temp"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      are quite well described by Eqn. <a href=
      "node34.html#eqnlinear"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      Ginzburg-Landau models predict a linear
      temperature-dependence of H<sub>c2</sub> in their region of
      validity, so this result is not surprising, especially since
      Iye and Tanuma[<a href="node66.html#iye82">120</a>] found
      linear temperature dependence for their C<sub>4</sub>KHg
      samples. One feature of Table <a href=
      "node34.html#linearparams"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      that merits some discussion is that the T<sub>c</sub>
      determined from the best linear fit is as much as 10% higher
      than that determined from the zero-field temperature sweeps.
      This disparity between the different ways of measuring
      T<sub>c</sub> is a fairly common occurrence in
      superconductivity which is generally caused by curvature of
      the H<sub>c2</sub>(T) data in the region near
      T<sub>c</sub>.[<a href="node66.html#orlando79">186</a>]
      Hohenberg and Werthamer[<a href=
      "node66.html#hohenberg67">111</a>] found that Fermi-surface
      anisotropy can cause positive curvature of the critical field
      near T<sub>c</sub>, but here negative curvature is needed in
      order to explain the high extrapolated values of
      T<sub>c</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the higher- T<sub>c</sub> specimens, the T<sub>c</sub>
      numbers found from the <i>vec</i>H || ^c fits are higher than
      those found from the <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c fits. Because of the
      discussion of type I superconductivity in the Section <a
      href="node30.html#typeI"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      one might wonder if the H<sub>c2, || ^c</sub>(T) data in
      these samples are actually quadratic, since a quadratic
      temperature dependence is expected for measurements of the
      thermodynamic critical field. A moment's thought indicates
      that a linear fit to a quadratic function will have a higher
      intercept on the x-axis than a quadratic fit will. (Se Figure
      <a href="node34.html#hparvst"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> .) Therefore, if the data are truly quadratic, it is
      easy to see why a linear fit will give a falsely high
      T<sub>c</sub>. The temperature dependence data for the
      T<sub>c</sub> 1.5 K GIC's for <i>vec</i>H ||^c are shown on
      an expanded scale in Figure <a href=
      "node34.html#hparvst"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>,
      along with the best quadratic and linear fits. This plot is
      quite similar to Figure <a href="node30.html#hcfig"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> , where the presumed
      thermodynamic critical field values were obtained from fits
      to H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>). Here the data were obtained
      directly, using field sweeps at constant <i>theta</i> as a
      function of temperature.

    </p>
    <p>
      Figure <a href="node34.html#hparvst"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> shows that using a
      quadratic function to fit the <i>vec</i>H || ^c data does
      improve the agreement between the fit T<sub>c</sub> and that
      obtained from a zero-field sweep. Unfortunately, the
      quadratic function does not describe the data as well as a
      linear function: for one sample the residual for the
      quadratic fit is twice that of the linear fit, and for the
      other it is three times that of the linear fit. Consultation
      of standard tables[<a href="node66.html#bevington69">21</a>]
      shows that the difference between these fits has only about
      an even chance of being significant (for about 15 data
      points). Therefore the only safe statement is that the
      question of type I superconductivity in C<sub>4</sub>KHg is
      still unresolved, since the fits to H<sub>c2, || ^c</sub> are
      inconclusive. As was mentioned in relation to Figure <a href=
      "node30.html#hcfig"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      in C<sub>8</sub>K both H<sub>c</sub>(T) and H<sub>c2,_|_
      ^c</sub>(T) show positive curvature,[<a href=
      "node66.html#koike80">141</a>] so perhaps in C<sub>4</sub>KHg
      it is not implausible for both critical fields to show a
      linear temperature dependence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some lower- T<sub>c</sub> samples, such as the T<sub>c</sub>
      = 0.95 K specimen whose data is shown in Figure <a href=
      "node34.html#hc2temp"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      (and others whose data are not displayed) showed
      T<sub>c</sub>'s which were higher than the zero-field values
      for both field orientations. This fact suggests that some
      experimental error is causing the discrepancies. Because the
      <i>vec</i>H || ^c measurements were usually taken going down
      in temperature, and those for <i>vec</i>H _|_ ^c were
      generally taken going up in temperature (see Section <a href=
      "node27.html#procedure"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      ), it appears unlikely that systematic temperature
      measurement problems are responsible. At this time the high
      values of T<sub>c</sub> obtained from the H<sub>c2, ||
      ^c</sub> fits remain unexplained, but it is felt that some
      type of measurement problem is the most likely cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another unexpected feature of the data for both orientations
      is that the linearity of H<sub>c2</sub>(t) persists to
      unusually low reduced temperatures. For typical type II
      superconductors, Eqn. <a href="node34.html#eqnlinear"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> holds only for about 0.6
      <b>&lt;</b> t <b>&lt;</b> 1.0, below which a saturation in
      H<sub>c2</sub>(t) becomes noticeable. This saturation is
      described quantitatively by the widely accepted theory of
      Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg (WHH)[<a href=
      "node66.html#werthamer66">262</a>] which has been successful
      in describing a wide variety of superconducting materials[<a
      href="node66.html#orlando79">186</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#fetter69">84</a>]. Anisotropic materials which
      are described by the AGL model for their angular dependence
      are expected to have a temperature dependence at constant
      angle describable by the WHH theory. The basic equation of
      this theory is one developed by Maki and deGennes[<a href=
      "node66.html#saintjames69">210</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#helfand66">108</a>]:

      where t is the reduced temperature, D is the diffusivity, and
      the digamma function <i>psi</i>(x) is related to the gamma

    </p>
    <p>
      <img align="bottom" alt="" src="img78.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      This equation is strictly applicable only to dirty
      superconductors or clean superconductors near T<sub>c</sub>,
      but the theory has been extended to lower temperatures for
      clean superconductors by Helfand and Werthamer[<a href=
      "node66.html#helfand66">108</a>]. The contribution of WHH[<a
      href="node66.html#werthamer66">262</a>] was to further extend
      the theory to incorporate effects due to Pauli paramagnetism
      and spin-orbit coupling. The meaning and possible importance
      of these embellishments is discussed below in Section <a
      href="node37.html#spinorbit"><img width="13" height="13"

      This formula is the quantitative expression of the saturation
      shown in the WHH curves of Figure <a href=

      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      saturation which the data does not appear to exhibit. The
      better agreement of the linear fits than the WHH fits is
      confirmed by the residual indices, which are significantly
      lower for the linear fits.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more impressive demonstration of linearity is shown in
      Figure <a href="node34.html#sumtemp"><img width="13" height=

      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>, which gathers together

    <p>
      For these 143 data points, the residual index for the linear
      fit is 3/4 that of the WHH fit, indicative of about a 90 %
      probability that the line describes the data better. Figure

      zero-temperature value of h<sup>*</sup> calculated using the
      Helfand-Werthamer[<a href="node66.html#helfand66">108</a>]
      formalism. Therefore, while it would be gratifying to measure
      H<sub>c2</sub>(t) to lower reduced temperatures and see even
      larger deviations from the WHH theory, the available data
      (down to t = 0.3) demonstrate convincingly that the observed
      deviations are real.

      The conclusions drawn here are perfectly consistent with
      those stated by Iye and Tanuma in their papers on
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg.[<a href="node66.html#iye82">120</a>] The
      reason is that their data extended over a smaller temperature
      range than the MIT data. At the lowest reduced temperature
      for which they reported measurements on C<sub>4</sub>KHg, t =
      0.55, linear character is consistent with both the WHH and
      linear fits, as Figure <a href="node34.html#sumtemp"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> shows. Therefore
      extended linearity was unobservable in Iye and Tanuma's
      samples in the temperature interval in which they performed
      measurements. It should be noted, though, that unusual
      H<sub>c2</sub>(T) behavior may not occur in the lower-
      T<sub>c</sub> samples. Considering that the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) for the lower- T<sub>c</sub>
      GIC's were well-described by the simple AGL model, it seems
      reasonable that the lower- T<sub>c</sub> H<sub>c2</sub>(T)
      curves may agree well with the Maki-deGennes equation.

      shows that there is a lot more information that can be
      extracted from the H<sub>c2</sub>(T) data. To begin with, the
      value of <i>epsilon</i>, the anisotropy parameter,[<a href=

      and compared with the <i>epsilon</i> obtained from fits to
      the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data. The resultant numbers
      are displayed in Table <a href="node34.html#epstab"><img

      slopes. The H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) numbers were
      obtained from fits using Eqns. <a href=

      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> (Tinkham's formula),
      with type I superconductivity allowed for small <i>theta</i>.
      In each case, the TF fits had lower residuals than the AGL
      fits (see Table <a href="node32.html#residsum"><img width=
      "13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ). NA indicates that a
      TF fit was not performed on this data; NR denotes information
      that was not reported in the cited reference.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As the table shows, agreement between the two methods of
      determining <i>epsilon</i> is rather poor. While
      <i>epsilon</i> as determined from H<sub>c2</sub>(T) is
      consistently about 9, that determined from
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) ranges from 8 to 16. The reason
      that the angular dependence's <i>epsilon</i>'s are higher is
      that in fitting H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) it has been
      assumed that the number measured for H<sub>c2</sub>(0&deg;)
      is actually H<sub>c</sub>, and that the real value of
      H<sub>c2</sub>(0&deg;) is much lower. As discussed in Section
      <a href="node30.html#typeI"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> , the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data cannot be fit
      without making use of this assumption. In addition, the
      presence of type I superconductivity is supported by the
      C<sub>v</sub> measurements done by Alexander <em>et
      al.</em>[<a href="node66.html#alexander81">8</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      It is tempting to conclude that the values for <i>epsilon</i>
      determined from the angular dependence are unreliable because
      of problems with the fits. The matter is not that simple
      though, since the variability of <i>epsilon</i> can be
      demonstrated in a model-independent way using the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data, without benefit of fits.
      One way of doing this is to plot
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)/H<sub>c2</sub>(0&deg;) versus
      <i>theta</i>. This scaling forces the curves through the
      common point (0&deg;, 1), with the value at the peak being
      1/<i>epsilon</i> at the temperature of measurement. If
      <i>epsilon</i> is in fact constant with respect to
      temperature, then the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)/H<sub>c2</sub>(0&deg;) versus
      <i>theta</i> curves should all overlay one another except for
      random errors.

       <strong>Figure:</strong> Demonstration of the temperature
      dependence of the anisotropy parameter <i>epsilon</i> in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg, where 1/<i>epsilon</i> ==
      H<sub>c2</sub>(90&deg;)/H<sub>c2</sub>(0&deg;). Data are for
      a T<sub>c</sub> = 1.54 K C<sub>4</sub>KHg sample.
      (<i>circ</i>), t = 0.29. (<i>bullet</i>), t = 0.55.
      (&times;), t = 0.76. All H<sub>c2</sub>(0&deg;) values were
      determined from the data, not the fits, so that this plot is
      model-independent. Fits to this data are shown in Figure <a
      href="node30.html#hctemp"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      .<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That this is not the case is demonstrated in Figure <a href=
      "node34.html#epstemp"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      The t = 0.55 and t = 0.76 curves appear to overlay for the
      most part, but the t = 0.29 curve clearly rises above the
      other two at the peak. Figure <a href=
      "node34.html#epstemp"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      therefore suggests that the variation in <i>epsilon</i>
      between t = 0.29 and t = 0.55 is real, but that any variation
      between t = 0.55 and t = 0.76 is at best small. From Table <a
      href="node34.html#epstab"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      one can see that the magnitudes of <i>epsilon</i> from the
      best fits (to Tinkham's formula) support this conclusion,
      although the verdict of the higher-residual AGL fits is less
      clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      A temperature-dependent <i>epsilon</i> implies a
      temperature-dependent slope in at least one of the
      high-symmetry directions. To be more precise, an increase in
      the anisotropy at low reduced temperatures requires either a
      downward deviation from linearity in H<sub>c2, || ^c</sub> or
      an upward deviation from linearity in H<sub>c2, _|_ ^c</sub>.
      While it is certainly true that neither of these trends is
      obvious in the H<sub>c2</sub>(T) data, it also turns out that
      neither of these is ruled out. The reason is that if the idea
      of type I superconductivity in C<sub>4</sub>KHg is taken
      seriously, then the data plotted in Figure <a href=
      "node34.html#hc2temp"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      b) are H<sub>c</sub> rather than H<sub>c2</sub>, and so make
      no statement about any hypothetical curvature of H<sub>c2, ||
      ^c</sub>(T). Any positive curvature of H<sub>c2, _|_ ^c</sub>
      would be lost in the noise of the data at low reduced
      temperatures, so that any kink of the size predicted by the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) would be unobservable.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what are the best numbers for <i>epsilon</i>(T) from the
      sum total of these data sets? One important point to notice
      is that the magnitude of the anisotropy derived from the
      linear fits to the H<sub>c2</sub>(T) curves represents a sort
      of thermal average. Thus <i>epsilon</i> = 9 is probably the
      mean value over the range 0.3 <b>&lt;</b> t <b>&lt;</b> 0.95.
      The evidence from the angular dependence, which measures the
      anisotropy at a specific t, indicates that the true
      <i>epsilon</i> is higher at low reduced temperatures and
      lower at higher reduced temperatures. Because the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data is much less affected by
      experimental errors, the magnitudes of <i>epsilon</i>
      determined from the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) fits are
      thought to be more reliable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temperature-dependent anisotropy has been observed before in
      graphite intercalation compounds, specifically in
      C<sub>8</sub>KHg by Iye and Tanuma. The increase in
      anisotropy from 17.6 at t = 0.81 to 21.6 at t = 0.23 is
      illustrated in Figure <a href="node34.html#stiiepstemp"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. The variation of
      <i>epsilon</i> shown there is similar to what is reported
      here for C<sub>4</sub>KHg. C<sub>8</sub>KHg is the only GIC
      for which Iye and Tanuma showed H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)
      curves at more than one temperature. This is unfortunate,
      since it would be interesting to know whether a variable
      <i>epsilon</i> is a general property of GIC superconductors.

    </p>
    <p>
      There is some justification for speculating that a
      temperature-dependent anisotropy is a common property of the
      class. According to data shown in Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#iye82">120</a>], all of the superconducting
      GIC's (with the possible exception of C<sub>4</sub>KHg) show
      positive curvature of their upper critical fields with
      respect to temperature (d
      H<sub>c2</sub><sup>2</sup>/dT<sup>2</sup> <b>&gt;</b> 0). The
      largest curvature seems to occur in C<sub>8</sub>RbHg, as the
      data in Figure <a href="node34.html#rbhct"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> show. Positive curvature
      does not guarantee a variable <i>epsilon</i>, of course, but
      the chances of exactly the same curvature in both critical
      fields seems small. In terms of the theories described in
      Section <a href="node35.html#models"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>, identical curvature in
      both of the orientations would be a coincidence rather than a
      natural consequence of the models (although identical
      curvature for both orientations has been reported for at
      least one compound, Fe<sub>0.05</sub>TaS<sub>2</sub>[<a href=
      "node66.html#coleman83">46</a>]). These models are discussed
      in more detail in the section that follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the section that follows, reference will frequently be
      made to theories which predict positive curvature of
      H<sub>c2</sub>(T). These references should not be understood
      as suggestions that positive curvature is observed in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg, but rather as expressions of the philosophy
      that whatever phenomena are the cause of the positive
      curvature in C<sub>8</sub>RbHg are most likely also to cause
      the extended linearity seen in C<sub>4</sub>KHg. Theories
      which can produce upward-curving critical field curves should
      easily be able to produce straight ones through adjustment of
      parameters. In these models, after all, a straight
      H<sub>c2</sub>(T) means merely the compensation of the forces
      which drive upward and downward curvature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before moving on to the interpretation of these results,
      let's pause to summarize. In C<sub>4</sub>KHg, the critical
      field both perpendicular and parallel to the graphite c-axis
      shows enhanced linearity with respect to the usual theory for
      type II superconductors. The data parallel to ^c are only
      marginally consistent with the quadratic behavior expected
      for the thermodynamic critical field of type I
      superconductors. However, H<sub>c</sub>(T) in C<sub>8</sub>K
      is not well-fit by a quadratic, either. Clem has shown that
      superconducting energy gap anisotropy can cause a slight
      deviation from the BCS temperature dependence of
      H<sub>c</sub>.[<a href="node66.html#clem66">44</a>] However,
      the deviation expected in Clem's theory is so small that his
      model should not be considered a serious candidate to explain
      the deviations seen in GIC's. The introduction of the
      possibility of type I superconductivity was suggested by the
      specific heat data of Alexander <em>et al.</em>, and also by
      the poor quality of the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) fits
      without it. The H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) fits also
      suggest that the anisotropy parameter <i>epsilon</i> is
      temperature-dependent. Both the temperature dependence of
      <i>epsilon</i> and the enhanced linearity of
      H<sub>c2</sub>(T) are inexplicable within the simple
      anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory,[<a href=
      "node66.html#tilley65">244</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#lawrence71">155</a>] although basically the data
      are well-described by this model. The AGL and other, more
      detailed, models are discussed at length in the next section.
