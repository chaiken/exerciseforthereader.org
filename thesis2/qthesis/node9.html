    <p>
      Work on artificially structured superconducting superlattices
      up to 1984 was reviewed by Ruggiero and Beasley.[<a href=
      "node66.html#ruggiero85">209</a>] Results in the
      superconductivity of artificial superlattices are much
      broader in variety than those in the TMDC and their
      intercalation compounds, encompassing such species as
      superconductor/superconductor (S/S'), superconductor/normal
      metal (S/N), superconductor/insulator (S/I), and
      superconductor/magnetic (S/M) compounds. A greater variety of
      materials combinations is possible with high-vacuum
      vapor-phase deposition techniques because the sample grower
      is no longer limited to phases which represent a global
      free-energy minimum. These new synthesis methods are just
      beginning to play a role in some areas of materials research,
      but they have already made possible real advances in the
      field of superconductivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some parameters from a few of the many recent superlattice
      experiments are gathered in Table 2.3. It is not possible to
      make a neat summary of the superconductivity of the
      artificially structured superlattices the way it is possible
      for the TMDC's. The reason clearly is that for any two
      materials that might be chosen for use in a superlattice, a
      potentially unlimited range of thickness ratios can be used.
      This situation corresponds to having stages 1 through
      infinity in an intercalation compound. With modern
      preparation techniques, even the "stage 1" limit of alternate
      monolayers of two different materials may have been achieved
      in the Mo/Ta system.[<a href="node66.html#makous87">160</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      The category of S/I superlattices was the first to be
      investigated. Pioneering work was done on the Al/Ge system by
      Haywood and Ast.[<a href="node66.html#haywood78">105</a>] The
      dimensionality crossover model of Klemm, Luther and
      Beasley[<a href="node66.html#klemm75">131</a>] was developed
      specifically for the S/I case, where the interlayer coupling
      occurs through tunnelling of Cooper pairs through the
      insulating layers. The excellent agreement of the KLB model
      with H<sub>c2</sub>(T) data for an S/I superlattice (Nb/Ge)
      is shown in Figure 2.4. The dimensional crossover here is
      more impressive than it was in the case of the TMDCIC's,
      where there were fewer data points on the 2D side of the
      curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
       <strong>Figure 2.4:</strong> Evidence for dimensionality
      crossover in a Nb/Ge superlattice.[<a href=
      "node66.html#ruggiero82">208</a>] Solid lines are fits to the
      KLB theory.[<a href="node66.html#klemm75">131</a>] The
      direction marked ``||'' means _|_ ^c in the vernacular of
      GIC's and the direction marked ``_|_'' is || ^c in GIC terms.
      The H<sub>c2</sub> data marked _|_ is almost unaffected by
      the dimensionality crossover. The H<sub>c2</sub> data marked
      || covers the range from the fully 3D regime (45 &Aring;/ 7
      &Aring; specimen) to the fully 2D regime (45 &Aring;/ 50
      &Aring; specimen). The intermediate 65 &Aring;/35 &Aring;
      specimen shows a crossover from 3D to 2D character as the
      temperature is lowered.<br />
       More recent studies have concentrated on S/S' and S/N
      multilayers with niobium as one element. The
      Josephson-tunnelling theory does not apply quantitatively to
      these other types of superlattices, because they are coupled
      through the superconducting proximity effect. The S/N and
      S/S' multilayers are described by new proximity-effect
      theories.[<a href="node66.html#biagi85">22</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#takahashi86b">235</a>] Although these new models
      differ in detail from the KLB model, the basic physics of the
      progressive decoupling of superconducting layers at low
      temperatures remains the same. The root cause of the
      low-temperature decoupling of superconducting layers is the
      decrease of the coherence length in each case. A
      dimensionality crossover has been observed in the critical
      field behavior in several different systems, including the
      S/N systems Nb/Cu,[<a href="node66.html#chun84">42</a>], and
      V/Ag,[<a href="node66.html#kanoda86">126</a>] and the S/S'
      system Nb/Ta.[<a href="node66.html#broussard87">30</a>] In
      these materials, as in the TMDCIC's and S/I multilayers, the
      crossover is manifested by a discontinuity in the temperature
      dependence of the critical field. The identification of the
      kink in H<sub>c2</sub>(T) with an effective dimensionality
      change is confirmed by the good agreement obtained by several
      groups[<a href="node66.html#chun84">42</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#broussard87">30</a>] with the different
      approximate temperature dependences expected in the two
      regimes, namely the (1-t)<sup>1/2</sup> dependence in the 2D
      temperature region and the linear dependence near
      T<sub>c</sub>. The linear-to-square-root change in the
      temperature dependence in the Nb/Ta multilayers is shown in
      Figure 2.5.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
       <strong>Figure 2.5:</strong> H<sub>c2</sub>(t) data on Nb/Ta
      superlattices showing two low-temperature critical field
      discontinuities. From Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#broussard87">30</a>]. The discontinuity in slope
      at t 0.8-0.9 is the 3D-2D coupling change. The identity of
      the lower transition at t = 0.49 has not been definitely
      determined.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Figure 2.5 also demonstrates that the S/S' and S/N systems
      display additional phenomena besides the
      coupling-dimensionality change. The Nb/Ta multilayers show a
      second low-temperature critical field discontinuity after
      they have already become 2D-coupled. The origin of this
      second discontinuity is currently uncertain. It may be due to
      a shift of the flux-line-lattice from one set of layers to
      the other.[<a href="node66.html#takahashi86c">236</a>,<a
      href="node66.html#broussard87b">28</a>] There is obviously a
      lot of interesting work left to be done on the S/N and S/S'
      multilayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the strong experimental confirmation of a
      dimensionality crossover from the H<sub>c2</sub>(T)
      measurements, there is also positive corroboration from
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data. The Nb/Cu and Nb/Ta
      superconductors not only are fairly well-fit by Eqn. 4.3 in
      the temperature range where their behavior is
      three-dimensional, but they also are well-fit by Tinkham's
      formula (Eqn. 4.9) in their 2D-coupled range.[<a href=
      "node66.html#chun84">42</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#broussard87">30</a>] The agreement of the two
      different H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) formulae with Nb/Ta
      data in the two different temperature regions is displayed in
      Figure 2.6. The observation of a change in the coupling
      dimensionality in both the H<sub>c2</sub>(T) and
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) measurements is strong evidence
      that the KLB model contains the right physics.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
       <strong>Figure 2.6:</strong> H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)
      data on Nb/Ta superlattices from Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#broussard88">29</a>]. The data is for three
      samples at a reduced temperature t = 0.9. <i>Lambda</i> is
      the bilayer period, which corresponds to I<sub>c</sub> in the
      GIC case. Data in the trace marked 3D are fit with Eqn. 4.3
      while data in the traces marked 2D are fit with Eqn.
      4.6.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Interpretation of the angular dependence of the
      superconducting superlattices is not as clear-cut as the
      temperature dependence, where more universal behavior is
      seen. As shown in Figure 2.6 in the crossover region neither
      the 3D nor 2D formulae fits well. Chun <em>et al.</em> found
      a continuous variation between the 2D-type and 3D-type
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) behavior. Ruggiero <em>et
      al.</em> observed better agreement with Tinkham's formula in
      both the 2D and 3D regions of temperature.[<a href=
      "node66.html#ruggiero82">208</a>] While the agreement of
      theory and H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) experiments for some
      of the S/I and S/N systems at most temperatures is
      gratifying, it is clear that the behavior of
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) in anisotropic superconductors
      is not completely understood.[<a href=
      "node66.html#broussard87">30</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#ruggiero82">208</a>] The agreement between the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data and the two available
      formulae is usually at the semiquantitative level in the
      artificially structured superlattices, while the agreement in
      H<sub>c2</sub>(T) is usually quite good quantitatively.[<a
      href="node66.html#ruggiero82">208</a>] Quite possibly a
      calculation of the angular dependence of H<sub>c2</sub> near
      the dimensionality crossover in terms of the KLB and the
      proximity models would solve all these discrepancies. Such
      calculations have not been performed up to this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another somewhat puzzling aspect of the superconducting
      superlattice experiments is the positive curvature often
      observed in H<sub>c2, || ^c</sub>. Such positive curvature
      has been seen in both the Nb/Cu and Nb/Ta systems.[<a href=
      "node66.html#chun84">42</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#broussard87">30</a>] The coupling-dimensionality
      change should have no effect on H<sub>c2</sub> when the field
      is applied perpendicular to the layer planes since this
      critical field is determined solely by the in-plane transport
      properties. Broussard and Geballe[<a href=
      "node66.html#broussard87">30</a>] have attributed this
      positive curvature to the Fermi surface anisotropy of the Nb
      layers since it is similar to the positive curvature of Nb
      thin films. Biagi, Kogan, and Clem, on the other hand, say
      that the positive curvature seen in H<sub>c2, || ^c</sub> is
      due to the proximity effect.[<a href=
      "node66.html#biagi85">22</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Many interesting experiments have been performed on the
      superconducting multilayers besides the critical field
      experiments, as Table 2.3 suggests. The most relevant of
      these for the GIC work is the measurement of T<sub>c</sub>
      for different layer thicknesses. An example is shown in
      Figure 2.7, where T<sub>c</sub> is plotted versus layer
      thickness for the Nb/Cu multilayers. For large layer
      thicknesses, the increase of T<sub>c</sub> with increasing
      thickness of the superconducting component is in accord with
      the predictions of standard proximity-effect theories.[<a
      href="node66.html#cooper61">49</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#degennes66">54</a>] The standard
      proximity-effect prediction is indicated by the solid line.
      For small layer thicknesses, the proximity theory needs some
      modifications to explain the data. The dashed line is also a
      proximity-effect calculation, but it incorporates a
      thickness-dependent T<sub>c</sub> for the individual Nb
      layers.[<a href="node66.html#banerjee84">14</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the proximity effect is a feature of all interfaces
      formed by superconductors. It should not be confused with
      proximity <em>coupling</em>, which is a manifestation of the
      proximity effect that occurs only in the S/N and S/S'
      superlattices. Proximity coupling is the interlayer
      interaction in S/N superlattices which is mediated by the
      diffusion of Cooper pairs across the N layer. S/I interfaces
      can also exhibit the proximity effect, but proximity-effect
      depression of T<sub>c</sub> is quite small there. The size of
      the proximity-effect depression of T<sub>c</sub> goes as the
      factor <i>eta</i>, which is the ratio of the normal-state
      conductivities of the normal and superconducting layers
      (<i>eta</i> = <i>sigma</i><sub>N</sub> /
      <i>sigma</i><sub>S</sub>).[<a href=
      "node66.html#ruggiero82">208</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#degennes66">54</a>] Thus proximity effects are
      almost negligible at S/I interfaces. Because the proximity
      effect is too weak to couple the layers in S/I superlattices,
      the layers are coupled instead by Josephson tunnelling.[<a
      href="node66.html#ruggiero85">209</a>] The good agreement of
      the artificially structured superlattices with
      proximity-effect theories is in contrast with the mixed
      results for TDMCIC's (and GIC's).
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
       <strong>Figure 2.7:</strong> T<sub>c</sub> vs layer
      thickness in Nb/Cu superlattices. From Ref. [<a href=
      "node66.html#banerjee84">14</a>]. The decrease of
      T<sub>c</sub> with decreasing thickness of the
      superconducting component is predicted by proximity-effect
      theories.[<a href="node66.html#cooper61">49</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#degennes66">54</a>] The predictions of the
      standard proximity-effect theories is indicated by the solid
      line. The proximity effect calculation modified to allow a
      thickness-dependent T<sub>c</sub> for the Nb layers is
      indicated by the dashed line.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The study of metallic multilayers has been a growth area in
      physics and materials science.[<a href=
      "node66.html#mrs87">15</a>] Already there have been some
      significant results from superconducting multilayers. The
      most impressive of these is the unambiguous observation of a
      coupling-dimensionality crossover in both H<sub>c2</sub>(T)
      and H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>).[<a href=
      "node66.html#ruggiero82">208</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#chun84">42</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#kanoda86">126</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#broussard87">30</a>] The real promise of the
      synthetic superlattices lies in the studies of new effects
      not easily observable in GIC's or TMDCIC's, such as the
      competition between superconductivity and magnetism in Mo/Ni
      superlattices,[<a href="node66.html#uher86">256</a>] or the
      two low-temperature transitions observed in the Nb/Ta
      superlattices.[<a href="node66.html#broussard87">30</a>] The
      superconducting multilayer work has been somewhat eclipsed by
      the excitement over high-temperature superconductors, but
      hopefully it will continue to be pursued, both because of its
      intrinsic interest and its relevance to the high-
      T<sub>c</sub> field.
