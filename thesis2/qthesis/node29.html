      As was discussed in Section <a href=
      "node27.html#procedure"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      one of the possible extrinsic causes of the deviations in
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) is that the GIC's a-axis may not
      have been mounted perfectly vertically. Figure <a href=
      "node29.html#misalign"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      a) shows the properly aligned case for reference, and Figure
      <a href="node29.html#misalign"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> b) illustrates the case where the sample is placed
      inside the inductance bridge with its c-axis rotated by an
      angle &oslash; from the horizontal. In both a) and b), the
      laboratory vertical is called ^z. The sample in-plane axes
      are denoted by ^a and ^a<sup>'</sup>. Thus in a) ^z and
      ^a<sup>'</sup> are parallel, whereas in b), the misaligned
      case, the angle between ^z and ^a<sup>'</sup> is also
      &oslash;. Since the measurements described here were done on
      HOPG, the sample's c-axis is a well-defined crystallographic
      direction, but the crystallites are randomly oriented
      in-plane, and so the directions ^a and ^a<sup>'</sup> are
      designated merely for convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The important point to notice here is that in b) the ^a axis
      is still in the horizontal plane, even though the c-axis is
      not. Therefore rotation of the sample about ^z will allow
      correct measurement of H<sub>c2,|| ^a</sub> = H<sub>c2,_|_
      ^c</sub>, but the value measured for H<sub>c2, || ^c</sub>
      will be off be a factor corresponding to &oslash; degrees. In
      fact, the minimum in the measured
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) will come when <i>vec</i>H is in
      the plane defined by the vector ^c and ^z. Through use of
      Eqn. <a href="node28.html#ldtheor"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>, one can see that the
      minimum measured critical field for the misaligned case will
      be H<sub>c2</sub>(0&deg;)/<i>sqrt</i><i>cos</i><sup>2</sup>
      &oslash; + <i>epsilon</i><sup>2</sup> <i>sin</i><sup>2</sup>
      &oslash;. With a bit more effort, by following the original
      derivation of Morris, Coleman, and Bhandari[<a href=
      "node66.html#morris72">175</a>] the formula for
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) for a specimen tilted by an
      angle &oslash; can be derived:<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="tilthc2" name="tilthc2">&nbsp;</a><img align="bottom"
      alt="" src="img50.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The detailed derivation of this formula is outlined in
      Appendix <a href="node64.html#tiltderiv"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. If one lets H<sub>c2,||
      ^c</sub><sup>eff</sup> == H<sub>c2,||
      ^c</sub>/<i>sqrt</i><i>cos</i><sup>2</sup>&oslash; +
      <i>epsilon</i><sup>2</sup><i>sin</i><sup>2</sup>&oslash; and
      <i>epsilon</i><sup>eff</sup> ==
      <i>epsilon</i>/<i>sqrt</i><i>cos</i><sup>2</sup>&oslash; +
      <i>epsilon</i><sup>2</sup><i>sin</i><sup>2</sup>&oslash;,
      then one recovers the form <a href="node28.html#ldtheor"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> only with the effective
      quantities replacing the actual ones. The impact of a
      non-zero tilt angle is therefore to increase the measured
      value of H<sub>c2,|| ^c</sub> but not to change the measured
      value of H<sub>c2,_|_ ^c</sub>, therefore reducing the
      apparent anisotropy, 1/<i>epsilon</i> =
      H<sub>c2,_|_^c</sub>/H<sub>c2,|| ^c</sub>. Since the
      experimental data in Figure <a href=
      "node28.html#hc2theta"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      b) is higher than the fit near <i>vec</i>H||^c, sample tilt
      seems like a good candidate for explaining the discrepancy.
      However, the impact of tilt for a plausible range of &oslash;
      is quite small since H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) is quite
      flat near <i>theta</i> = 0. The minute amount of distortion
      of the curves that occurs for a believable tilt angle
      (&oslash; &lt;= 5&deg;) is demonstrated in Figure <a href=
      "node29.html#tilteffect"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      After examining this figure one can conclude that the effect
      of specimen tilt on H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) is probably
      unimportant.

       <strong>Figure:</strong> Why a tilted sample affects the
      shape of H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>). The notation (
      <i>vec</i>H <i>cdot</i> ^x)^x signifies the projection of
      <i>vec</i>H along ^x. a) The aligned case. Rotations of the
      sample around the vertical ^z allow <i>theta</i> to be varied
      all the way from ( <i>vec</i>H||^c) to ( <i>vec</i>H_|_^c) (
      <i>vec</i>H_|_^c = <i>vec</i>H|| ^a). b) The misaligned case.
      H<sub>c2,_|_^c</sub> can still be measured correctly, but
      instead of the true value of H<sub>c2||^c</sub> one will get
      H<sub>c2,||^c</sub>/<i>sqrt</i><i>cos</i><sup>2</sup>&oslash;
      +

       <strong>Figure:</strong> The effect of sample tilt on

      picture were calculated using the parameters H<sub>c2,||
      ^c</sub> = 42 Oe, anisotropy == 1/<i>epsilon</i> = 15 and the
      following values for the tilt angle: (<i>circ</i>) &oslash; =
      0&deg;; (<i>bullet</i>) &oslash; = 10&deg;; (<i>diamond</i>)
      &oslash; = 40&deg;. The &oslash; = 0&deg; curve corresponds
      to one of the fits shown in Figure <a href=
      "node28.html#hc2theta"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>

      &oslash; = 0&deg; are almost indistinguishable.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides macroscopic tilt of the specimen, there is another
      type of misalignment that can influence the shape of the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) curves. A microscopic type of
      misalignment is mosaic spread, which in this context means
      the half-width-at-half-maximum-intensity (HWHM) of a GIC's
      (00<i>l</i>) peaks in a diffractometer rocking scan. The
      mosaic spread is a measure of the degree to which the c-axes
      of the crystallites in a piece of HOPG are aligned. Clearly
      if the planes of a GIC are not flat, the peak in
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) will be somewhat smeared out.
      Therefore, a finite amount of mosaic spread will reduce the
      anisotropy ratio by reducing H<sub>c2</sub>(90&deg;) =
      H<sub>c2,_|_ ^c</sub>. The effect of mosaic spread on the
      critical fields of the GIC superconductors was estimated by
      convolving the formula in Equation <a href=
      "node28.html#ldtheor"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      with a gaussian function to represent the probability of
      misalignment as a function of misalignment angle. With a
      gaussian distribution of misaligned crystallites, for each
      increment <i>Delta</i> away from perfect alignment, there is
      a reduction by a factor 1/<b>e</b> in probability. Therefore
      only orientations within about <i>Delta</i> degrees of
      perfect alignment contribute significantly. The form of the
      expression is:<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a id="mostheta" name="mostheta">&nbsp;</a><img align=
      "bottom" alt="" src="img53.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      where <i>theta</i> is the angle for which the critical field
      is being calculated, <i>theta</i><sub>i</sub> is the dummy
      variable (which runs from 0&deg; to 180&deg;), and
      <i>Delta</i> is the mosaic spread in degrees. The results of
      the calculations are exemplified by the curves in Figure <a
      href="node29.html#mospread"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />

       <strong>Figure:</strong> The effect of mosaic spread on
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>), calculated using Equation <a
      href="node29.html#mostheta"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> . The same parameters were used as in Figure <a href=
      "node29.html#tilteffect"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      except that here the mosaic spread, <i>Delta</i>, is varied:
      (<i>circ</i>) <i>Delta</i> = 0&deg;; (<i>bullet</i>)
      <i>Delta</i> = 3&deg;; (<i>diamond</i>) <i>Delta</i> =
      10&deg;.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The most appropriate HWHM of the gaussian would be the mosaic
      spread measured by (00<i>l</i>) diffraction, if known. In the
      present work the mosaic spread was unknown, and so
      <i>Delta</i> was used as a parameter in the fits. Because a
      non-zero mosaic spread makes the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>)
      curves broader, it actually worsened agreement between
      experiment and theory, since the theoretical curves are
      already too broad in the wings of the peak. This finding does
      not, of course, indicate that the GIC's used in these
      experiments were perfect crystals; rather it is an indication
      that the real cause of the unsatisfactory fits for the
      T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K samples has not yet been identified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of multiple crystalline or disordered phases in
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg is another property that could impact upon
      the angular dependence curves. The differing properties of
      the two phases are discussed in detail in Chapter <a href=
      "node40.html#hydrog"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      As far as the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) curves go, it
      suffices to say that since the phases may have different
      T<sub>c</sub>'s, they could have different upper critical
      fields. If these two phases are distributed inhomogenenously
      in the GIC's, then at the lowest temperatures, where both of
      them are superconducting, their presence could distort
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>). However, the temperature and
      sample dependence of the quality of the fits weigh against
      this interpretation. For one thing, Figure <a href=
      "node28.html#hc2theta"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      b) shows that the H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) curves are
      quite reproducible from sample to sample, an unlikely
      occurrence if the distribution of phases is important.
      Secondly, as mentioned in connection with Figure <a href=
      "node30.html#thetatemp"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      the quality of the fits improves with decreasing temperature,
      the opposite of what would be expected if a lower-
      T<sub>c</sub> minority phase were causing the deviations.
      Thirdly, the samples which show larger deviations from the
      AGL functional form have narrower zero-field transitions than
      the lower- T<sub>c</sub> specimens which are well-fit by Eqn.
      <a href="node28.html#ldtheor"><img width="13" height="13"
      align="bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" />
      </a> . X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments confirm that
      the higher- T<sub>c</sub> samples are actually more uniform
      than the lower- T<sub>c</sub> ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last of the extrinsic factors that needs to be considered
      as a explanation of the disagreement between the
      H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data and fits to the data is the
      possibility of bias influenced by the method of data
      reduction. As was discussed in Section <a href=
      "node27.html#procedure"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> ,
      the standard working definition of H<sub>c2</sub> (for
      inductive transitions) was used; this procedure gives
      H<sub>c2</sub> as the intersection of a tangent drawn to the
      most linear part of the field sweep with the level upper
      portion of the trace. The unavoidable question when
      encountering difficulties in fitting H<sub>c2</sub> data is
      whether there is any reason to expect agreement given that
      the theoretical definition of H<sub>c2</sub> is so different
      from the working one. That is, there is no guarantee that the
      field found by the procedure described above corresponds to
      the highest field where vortices can nucleate in the
      superconductor, which is the theoretical definition of
      H<sub>c2</sub>.[<a href="node66.html#tinkham80">252</a>,<a
      href="node66.html#helfand66">108</a>] The possibility of bias
      due to analysis is particularly troublesome for the study of
      H<sub>c2</sub> in anisotropic superconductors, where the
      transition shape can be a strong function of <i>theta</i>, as
      Figure <a href="node27.html#hc2def"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> b) shows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only response that an experimentalist can make to such
      criticism is that the procedure defined above is as good as
      any available, and that it is capable of producing data which
      are well-fit by Equation <a href="node28.html#ldtheor"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>, as Figure <a href=
      "node28.html#hc2theta"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      a) shows. In order to check for any bias introduced by the
      tangent method of critical field determination used here, the
      alternative definition of H<sub>c2</sub> as the 90%
      completion point of the transition was also tried in
      analyzing some H<sub>c2</sub>(<i>theta</i>) data sets. Figure
      <a href="node29.html#ninetytangent"><img width="13" height=
      "13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> is a comparison of the
      curves obtained using the two different analysis techniques.
      As this juxtaposition shows, slightly different curves are
      produced by the two analysis methods. However, the agreement
      with Eqn. <a href="node28.html#ldtheor"><img width="13"
      height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> is not improved.
      Therefore it is thought that the unsatisfactory quality of
      the fits to the T<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 K samples is not an
      artifact of the analysis. In a similar vein, Decroux and
      Fischer have noted that H<sub>c2</sub> results on the
      molybdenum chalcogenide compounds (also called Chevrel
      phases) are not biased by the critical field definition as
      long as the compounds do not contain magnetic ions.[<a href=
      "node66.html#decroux82">53</a>]

      but there is only a small difference between the shapes of
