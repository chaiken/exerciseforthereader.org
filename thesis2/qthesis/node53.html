      The techniques used in the T<sub>c</sub> measurements on the
      CsBi-GIC's were nearly the same as those used for the
      KHg-GIC's, described in Section <a href=
      "node46.html#khghydexp"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      There were several differences, however. One was that the
      CsBi samples were routinely cleaved before the T<sub>c</sub>
      measurement so that any transition observed would be due to
      the bulk of the sample, and not a spurious effect arising
      from alloy adsorbed on the surface. Lagrange and coworkers do
      not report whether they cleaved their samples or not.
      KHg-GIC's very rarely had any adsorbed alloy since their
      intercalation is accomplished through a vapor-phase reaction,
      in contrast to the contact reaction necessary to intercalate
      the MBi-GIC's. Therefore, KHg samples were not generally
      cleaved before T<sub>c</sub> measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because cleaving is a difficult operation to perform in the
      glovebox on small samples, the CsBi-GIC's were cleaved in
      air. Handling in air was also necessary to perform the
      weight-uptake measurements described in Section <a href=
      "node19.html#chemanal"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a> .
      Because of the compounds' excellent stability in air,[<a
      href="node66.html#lagrange87">145</a>] the brief exposures to
      air were not thought to influence the superconductivity
      experiments. The work of the Nancy group does not state
      whether their samples were exposed to air before the
      low-temperature experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CsBi-GIC's were place in glass ampoules for the
      low-temperature experiments. They were not fixed in metal
      sample-holders as the KHg-GIC's were [See Section <a href=
      "node25.html#mounting"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      ], though, because no critical field measurements were
      performed on them. The inductive T<sub>c</sub> measurements
      were performed on the CsBi-GIC's in the same manner as on the
      KHg-GIC's [See Section <a href="node24.html#critfexp"><img
      width="13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>]. The temperature range
      of the inductive measurements was from 4.2 K to about 0.4 K,
      just as for the KHg experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air stability of the CsBi compounds allowed resistive
      T<sub>c</sub> measurements to be performed easily on them.
      Contacts were made with silver paint on the edges of the GIC
      in a standard four-probe geometry. The samples were then
      encapsulated in a cell filled with helium gas for good
      thermal contact at low temperatures. Both zero-field
      temperature sweeps and fixed-temperature field sweeps were
      performed on CsBi <i>alpha</i>- and <i>alpha</i> +
      <i>beta</i>-phase samples. The temperature range of the
      resistive measurements was from liquid helium temperature
      (4.2 K) to about 1.1 K. Current densities used were on the
      order of 10<sup>-1</sup>-10<sup>-2</sup> A/cm<sup>2</sup>.
      The results did not depend on the current density employed.
      The values of the normal-state resistivity obtained from the
      temperature sweeps were estimated to be uncertain by about
      25% due to remanent fields in the Bitter magnets used for the
      Shubnikov-de Haas measurements.
