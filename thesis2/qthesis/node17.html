    <p>
      The motivation for the use of Raman scattering comes from
      previous Raman studies of the different phases of
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg by Timp and coworkers.[<a href=
      "node66.html#N128">247</a>] An extensive transmission
      electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman study by Timp <em>et
      al.</em> found zone-folded Raman modes associated with
      in-plane ordering. The identification of Raman peaks with
      zone-folded modes can give a clue to the in-plane ordering of
      GIC's, as explained below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zone-folded modes are zone-center (q = 0) phonons found in
      superlatices. These modes originate from the folding of the
      graphite bands into the zone-center that occurs in
      superlattice phases that have a larger real-space lattice
      constant than graphite, and hence a smaller Brillouin zone.
      Only q=0 modes participate in Raman processes due to the
      requirement of wave-vector conservation and the very small
      momentum of a photon compared to that of a typical phonon. In
      principle,[<a href="node66.html#F120">6</a>] and in
      practice,[<a href="node66.html#N128">247</a>] the comparison
      of the positions of zone-folded Raman peaks with theoretical
      models allows identification of the corresponding in-plane
      superlattice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Raman study of C<sub>4</sub>KHg was performed by Timp
      <em>et al.</em> in Ref. [<a href="node66.html#N128">247</a>].
      The essence of this paper is that the pink samples are
      identified primarily with a (2 &times; 2)R0&deg; in-plane
      superlattice, while red samples are identified primarily with
      a (<i>sqrt</i>3 &times; <i>sqrt</i>3)R30&deg; ordering.[<a
      href="node66.html#N128">247</a>] Figure 1.1 shows the atomic
      positions corresponding to these in-plane arrangements. The
      gold samples show no evidence of zone-folded peaks at all.[<a
      href="node66.html#N128">247</a>] Both the pink and red phases
      were found to contain as a minority constituent a
      (<i>sqrt</i>3 &times; 2)R(30&deg;, 0&deg;). The observation
      of the (2 &times; 2)R0&deg; and (<i>sqrt</i>3 &times;
      2)R(30&deg;, 0&deg;) phases is in good agreement with neutron
      diffraction,[<a href="node66.html#kamitakahara84">123</a>]
      x-ray diffraction,[<a href="node66.html#elmakrini80">70</a>]
      and TEM[<a href="node66.html#K167">246</a>] experiments.
      Kamitakahara[<a href="node66.html#kamitakahara84">123</a>]
      found using (10<i>l</i>) neutron diffraction spectra that the
      (2 &times; 2)R0&deg; and (<i>sqrt</i>3 &times; 2)R(30&deg;,
      0&deg;) phases correspond to the I<sub>c</sub> = 10.24
      &Aring; and I<sub>c</sub> = 10.83 &Aring; repeat distances.
      The x-ray, neutron, TEM and Raman experiments together
      unequivocally identify the 10.24 &Aring; <i>alpha</i>-phase
      with the (2 &times; 2)R0&deg; in-plane structure, and the
      10.83 &Aring; (<i>beta</i>)-phase with the (<i>sqrt</i>3
      &times; 2)R(30&deg;, 0&deg;) in-plane structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The (<i>sqrt</i>3 &times; <i>sqrt</i>3)R30&deg; phase has
      only been observed in the TEM and Raman[<a href=
      "node66.html#K167">246</a>] experiments, though. TEM shows
      that the (<i>sqrt</i>3 &times; <i>sqrt</i>3)R30&deg; phase
      appears to be associated with an anomalous (9.4 &plusmn;
      0.01) &Aring; repeat distance which is not seen in x-ray or
      neutron diffraction experiments, even by Timp. Timp[<a href=
      "node66.html#K167">246</a>] also finds a (<i>sqrt</i>3
      &times; <i>sqrt</i>3)R30&deg; phase in C<sub>8</sub>KHg
      associated with an anomalous (12.8 &plusmn; 0.1) &Aring;\
      repeat distance. The usual lattice constant for
      C<sub>8</sub>KHg is I<sub>c</sub> = 13.6 &Aring;.[<a href=
      "node66.html#kamitakahara84b">124</a>,<a href=
      "node66.html#K167">246</a>] Because TEM and Raman scattering
      are more surface-sensitive than x-ray and neutron
      diffraction, the observation of the (<i>sqrt</i>3 &times;
      <i>sqrt</i>3)R30&deg; structure only in the TEM and Raman
      experiments suggests that this phase might be found only near
      the sample surface. Although the evidence for the existence
      of the (<i>sqrt</i>3 &times; <i>sqrt</i>3)R30&deg; phase is
      compelling, none of this evidence proves that this structure
      is found in bulk KHg-GIC's.
    </p>
    <p>
      New Raman spectra were taken by Dr. G. Doll on pink and gold
      C<sub>4</sub>KHg samples at room temperature. The GIC's were
      HOPG-based and about 3 mm by 3mm by 1 mm in size. An argon
      ion laser's 4880 &Aring; line was focussed to a spot on the
      surface. Care was taken to limit the laser power to less than
      10 mW to avoid damaging the samples. Spectra taken on
      T<sub>c</sub> = 1.53 K and a T<sub>c</sub> = 0.719 K GIC's
      are shown in Figure <a href="node17.html#ramfig"><img width=
      "13" height="13" align="bottom" alt="gif" src=
      "/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>. The spectra were taken
      over a much wider range of frequencies than is indicated in
      the Figure, but the only peak observed in either sample is
      the one displayed. This peak corresponds to the
      E<sub>2g2</sub> mode of graphite.[<a href=
      "node66.html#N128">247</a>] The frequency of this peak in the
      new work is about 10 cm<sup>-1</sup> higher than in the
      experiments of Timp and coworkers.[<a href=
      "node66.html#N128">247</a>] Raman spectra were taken on 6
      other specimens whose data is not shown, but no zone-folded
      peaks were observed. X-ray diffraction scans taken after the
      Raman spectra showed no degradation in staging.

      gold sample with a single I<sub>c</sub> value = 10.14

      HWHM is 13.2 cm<sup>-1</sup>. b) Spectrum of a T<sub>c</sub>

      and the HWHM is 15.5 cm<sup>-1</sup>.<br />

    <p>
      It was hoped that the observation of zone-folded Raman peaks
      in C<sub>4</sub>KHg would allow a systematic study of the
      relationship between in-plane structure and
      superconductivity. As was shown in Section 3.4, the c-axis
      structure seemed to provide no information about the
      superconductivity since the (00<i>l</i>) scans of low-
      T<sub>c</sub> and high- T<sub>c</sub> specimens were
      identical. Unfortunately the new results on C<sub>4</sub>KHg
      Raman spectra also show the low- T<sub>c</sub> and high-
      T<sub>c</sub> samples to be identical, in that no zone-folded
      peaks were seen in any spectrum. The lack of zone-folded
      peaks would seem to imply in-plane disorder at least at the
      surface in these samples. Since T<sub>c</sub> measurements
      were taken on the same samples as the Raman spectra, and
      since there was no sample transfer in-between the
      T<sub>c</sub> measurement and the Raman experiment, one can
      conclude that the Raman experiments are much more sensitive
      to the in-plane order than the superconductivity is. The
      reason may well be that, as mentioned, Raman is a fairly
      surface-sensitive probe of ordering, while the T<sub>c</sub>
      measurements are sensitive to superconductivity anywhere in a
      sample's cross-section (see Figure <a href=
      "node26.html#scingfract"><img width="13" height="13" align=
      "bottom" alt="gif" src="/icons1//cross_ref_motif.png" /></a>
      ). Thus any exposure to air that might have occurred during
      the sample handling might have affected only the surface,
      which would show up in the Raman but not the
      superconductivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hydrogenated C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimens also showed only one
      peak in Raman scattering, a Lorentzian E<sub>2g2</sub> line
      at about 1598 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The spectra of the
      hydrogenated samples were basically indistinguishable from
      those of the pink and gold samples. A low-temperature Raman
      study of these different types of C<sub>4</sub>KHg might
      provide more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the (00<i>l</i>) x-ray data, the Raman data show almost
      no difference between the lower- T<sub>c</sub> and higher-
      T<sub>c</sub> C<sub>4</sub>KHg specimens. Therefore they can
      provide little insight into the relationship between the
      in-plane structure and superconductivity. In the hopes of
      answering these questions it was decided to try neutron
      diffraction. Since neutrons are quite sensitive to hydrogen,
      neutron diffraction data taken before and after hydrogenation
      might offer important clues to the puzzle.
