      couldn't spel gud at Elis Iland. Albert was a door-to-door

      A: Of course. You can check out my brother Gary's business, <a
      href="http://www.villageskiandsport.com/">Village Ski and
      Sport</a> in Lincoln, NH. My cousin Warren is at <a href=
      "http://www.almo.com/">Almo Corp.</a>, the family business.  On
      my mother's side of the family there's John Darnton, Pulitzer
      Prize winner and author of the recent bestseller <a href=
      "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&amp;field-author=Darnton%2C%20John/103-2996863-3573466">

      Darnton</a>, author of the more scholarly <strong>Forbidden

      least, my grandfather Ernest A. Choate wrote <a
      href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?inkey=0-0876450656-0&amp;PID=28168&amp;PID=28168">Dictionary
      of American Bird Names</a>, which has been in print since 1973.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: What kind of name is Chaiken, anyway?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: My grandfather said the family is from Nezhin in the Ukraine.
      A Russian dictionary once told me that Chaiken means "sign of
      the seagull" and comes from the same root as
      Tchaikovsky. However, the reknowned Mikhail Zeleny believes that
      Chaiken means "tea merchant." <a href=
      "http://www.cooper.edu/~george/">George Chaikin</a> of Cooper
      Union in New York says his sources claim that chaika
      colloquially meant "lively woman" and that "Chaiken" was a name
      meaning "son of Chaika." Udi Cain authoritatively offers the
      opinion:
    </p>
    <pre>
    The Chaikin family (which is being written in Hebrew:
    Khet-Yod-Yod-Kof-Yod-Nun) are indeed of Belarussian origin.  Admo'r Chaim
    Chaikel, who was one of the first Hassidic Admo'rs, was a disciple of
    Rabbi Eliahu of Vilna, and became a student of Rabbi Dov Ber of Mazerich.
    His daughter married Moshe, son of Jacob and Perel, from Karlin (near
    Pinsk).  Moshe's famous brother, was Aharon (1736 - 1772), the founder of
    Karlin Hassidism.  Chaikel himself, was born to Rabbi Shmuel in Karlin,
    but died in Amdur (Indura) in 1787.  Moshe was nicknamed Chaikel's, which
    became Chaikin ! 
</pre>
    <p>
      Q: What is the city of Nezhin famous for?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: It's the cucumber capital of the former Soviet Union. (I
      know because a Tass correspondent told me!) And Nikolai Gogol
      was born there. Believe it or not, there is a <a href=
      "http://www.ourfamilystory.net/ChaikenofNezhin.html">Chaiken
      Family of Nezhin</a> webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
    Q: By any chance are you single and straight?
    </p>
    <p>
    A: Yes, on the off-chance that any single, straight male reader
    has persisted this far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Can <strong>women</strong> really be
      <strong>physicists</strong>?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Naturally. Women can even play electric guitar. <a href=
      "http://www.pretenders.org/advice.htm">Chrissie Hynde's
      advice to women rock-and-rollers</a> is, with a few obvious
      substitutions, excellent advice for women scientists as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: What is "exercise for the reader" anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
       A: The <a
       href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=exercise%20for%20the%20reader">most
       popular form of mathematical proof</a>.
