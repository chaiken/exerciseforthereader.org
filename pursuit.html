      Pursuit from Under
    </h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>
      by <a href="http://www.jamesdickey.org/">James Dickey</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Often, in these blue meadows,<br />
      I hear what passes for the bark of seals
    </p>
    <p>
      And on August week ends the cold of a personal ice age<br />
      Comes up through my bare feet<br />
      Which are trying to walk like a boy's again<br />
      So that nothing on earth can have changed<br />
      On the ground where I was raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark grass here is like<br />
      The pads of mukluks going on and on
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I once burned kerosene to read<br />
      Myself near the North Pole<br />
      In the journal of Arctic explorers<br />
      Found, years after death, preserved<br />
      In a tent, part of whose canvas they had eaten
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the last entry.<br />
      All over my father's land
    </p>
    <p>
      The seal holes sigh like an organ,<br />
      And one entry carries more terror<br />
      Than the blank page that signified death<br />
      In 1912, on the icecap.<br />
      It says that, under the ice,
    </p>
    <p>
      The killer whale darts and distorts,<br />
      Cut down by the flawing glass
    </p>
    <p>
      To a weasel's shadow,<br />
      And when, through his ceiling, he sees<br />
      Anything darker than snow<br />
      He falls away<br />
      To gather more and more force
    </p>
    <p>
      From the iron depths of cold water,<br />
      His shadow dwindling
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost to nothing at all, then charges<br />
      Straight up, looms up at the ice and smashes<br />
      Into it with his forehead<br />
      To splinter the roof, to isolate seal or man<br />
      On a drifting piece of the floe
    </p>
    <p>
      Which he can overturn.<br />
      If you run, he will follow you
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the frozen pane,<br />
      Turning as you do, zigzagging,<br />
      And at the most uncertain of your ground<br />
      Will shatter through, and lean,<br />
      And breathe frankly in your face
    </p>
    <p>
      An enormous breath smelling of fish.<br />
      With the lungs staining your air
    </p>
    <p>
      You know the unsaid recognition<br />
      Of which the explorers died:<br />
      They had been given an image<br />
      Of how the downed dead pursue us.<br />
      They knew, as they starved to death,
    </p>
    <p>
      That not only in the snow<br />
      But in the family field
    </p>
    <p>
      The small shadow moves,<br />
      And under the bare feet in the summer:<br />
      That somewhere the turf will heave,<br />
      And the outraged breath of the dead,<br />
      So long held, will form
    </p>
    <p>
      Unbreathably around the living.<br />
      The cows low oddly here
    </p>
    <p>
      As I pass, a small bidden shape<br />
      Going with me, trembling like foxfire<br />
      Under my heels and their hooves.<br />
      I shall write this by kerosene,<br />
      Pitch a tent in the pasture, and starve.

      There's been so much interest in James Dickey since his
      death, I thought I'd add another one of my favorites:
    </p>
    <h1>
      Bums on Waking
    </h1>
    <p>
      Bums, on waking,<br />
      Do not always find themselves<br />
      In gutters with water running over their legs<br />
      And the pillow of the curbstone<br />
      Turning hard as sleep drains from it.<br />
      Mostly, they do not know
    </p>
    <p>
      But hope for where they shall come to.<br />
      The opening of the eye is precious,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the shape of the body also,<br />
      Lying as it has fallen,<br />
      Disdainfully crumpling earthward<br />
      Out of alcohol.<br />
      Drunken under their eyelids<br />
      Like children sleeping toward Christmas,
    </p>
    <p>
      They wait for the light to shine<br />
      Wherever it may decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often it brings them staring<br />
      Through glass in the rich part of town,<br />
      Where the forms of humanized wax<br />
      Are arrested in midstride<br />
      With their heads turned, and dressed<br />
      By force. This is ordinary, and has come
    </p>
    <p>
      To be disappointing.<br />
      They expect and hope for
    </p>
    <p>
      Something totally other:<br />
      That while they staggered last night<br />
      For hours, they got clear,<br />
      Somehow, of the city; that they<br />
      Burst through a hedge, and are lying<br />
      In a trampled rose garden,<br />
      Pillowed on a bulldog's side,<br />
      A watchdog's, whose breathing
    </p>
    <p>
      Is like the earth's, unforced --<br />
      Or that they may, once a year<br />
      (Any dawn now), awaken<br />
      In church, not on the coffin boards<br />
      Of a back pew, or on furnace-room rags,<br />
      But on the steps of the altar
    </p>
    <p>
      Where candles are opening their eyes<br />
      With all-seeing light
    </p>
    <p>
      And the green stained-glass of the windows<br />
      Falls on them like sanctified leaves.<br />
      Who else has quite the same<br />
      Commitment to not being sure<br />
      What he shall behold, come from sleep --<br />
      A child, a policeman, an effigy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Who else has died and thus risen?<br />
      Never knowing how they have got there,
    </p>
    <p>
      They might just as well have walked<br />
      On water, through walls, out of graves,<br />
      Through potter's fields and through barns,<br />
      Through slums where their stony pillows<br />
      Refused to harden, because of<br />
      Their hope for this morning's first light,
    </p>
    <p>
      With water moving over their legs<br />
      More like living cover than it is.
