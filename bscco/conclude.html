    <p>
      Transmission electron microscopy is uniquely powerful when it
      comes to imaging point or line defects in a solid, or when
      one wants to image the structure of a single molecular layer
      in a film. Thus, TEM provides information about buried,
      localized features of thin films which is difficult to obtain
      in any other fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The TEM images taken as part of this study have strikingly
      confirmed previous hypotheses about the structure of
      heterostructures and multilayers grown with the ALL-MBE
      technique. In particular, the TEM images demonstrate that
      single layers of 2212 and 2201 can be grown as part of a
      multilayer. Furthermore, single layers of metastable or
      unstable phases such as 2278 and 1278 can also be grown.
      These TEM micrographs provide the first direct evidence for
      the existence of these phases. While growth flaws like twins,
      stacking faults and antiphase boundaries do occur, especially
      in overgrowths on metastable barrier layers, the images are
      most notable for the long, unbroken continuity of most 2212
      planes. Up to this point, ALL-MBE growth of BiSrCaCuO
      superconductors have not reached the perfection that is
      observed in MBE growth of GaAs, AlAs and related compounds.
      However, planned improvements in the ALL-MBE process such as
      rotation of the substrate during growth may make comparably
      low defect densities possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The TEM images presented here support previous ideas about
      the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity in the 2212
      compound.[6] In addition, they provide new information about
      the ways in which growth of inherently highly anisotropic
      phases may differ from growth of cubic materials. Studies of
      the growth of high-temperature superconductors may in the end
      have as much to teach us about anisotropic solids as about
      the fundamental nature of superconductivity.
