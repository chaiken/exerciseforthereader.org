      The crystal quality of 2201 and 2212 films grown on a
      SrTiO<sub>3</sub> substrate by ALL-MBE is very high, as
      described above. The only defects which are commonly observed
      in these films are twin boundaries, one of which is shown in
      Figure 5. Part of the image has the 2212 a-axis oriented
      normal to the plane of the paper; this portion appears to
      have long, unbroken BiO planes. The other part of the image
      has the 2212 b-axis oriented normal. The b-axis-oriented
      portion of the image displays the incommensurate modulation
      which has previously been observed in 2212 films.[20] It has
      been shown that the growth of untwinned films via ALL-MBE is
      possible by using specially miscut substrates.[21] However,
      the special precautions necessary to prevent twinning are not
      deemed to be worthwhile for routine growths since the
      presence of twins is not believed to affect the performance
      of Josephson junctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally more troublesome defects may occur. These
      defects include stacking faults and antiphase boundaries, as
      Figure 6 illustrates. The stacking fault defects are most
      easily visualized by observing the presence of the wrong
      number of BiO planes, although presumably the SrO planes and
      CaCuO<sub>2</sub> planes may also be affected. There are
      several places in the image of Figure 6 where apparently more
      than two BiO planes occur together. Nearby in the image, an
      arrow points to the spot where layer spacings indicate that
      two phases of different stoichiometry have grown together.
      Estimates of the layer thicknesses for these phases indicate
      that they may correspond to 2223, which has an extra
      CaCuO<sub>2</sub> slab, and 3312, which has an extra BiO-SrO
      unit.[7] Exactly why these off-stoichiometric phases and
      stacking fault defects occur has not yet been determined. For
      reasons which are not well-understood, the frequency of
      occurrence of these defects is greater above a 2278 or 1278
      barrier than in a 2212 film grown on a 2201 buffer layer. It
      may be hypothesized that the unfavorable charge balance in
      the unstable barrrier layer[17] may cause havoc in subsequent
      overgrowths.
    </p>
    <p>
      RBS, EDAX and SIMS measurements indicate that the overall
      composition of the films is within a few percent of the
      nominal stoichiometry. However, defects which are visible on
      the surface of the superconducting films with optical
      microscopy are found by RBS, SIMS and EDAX to have a
      substantially different stoichiometry.[7] These surface
      defects typically occur in the corners of the films, where
      the deviation from the nominal stoichiometry would be
      expected to be greatest because the thermal effusion sources
      are not exactly on-axis. A correlation between the occurrence
      of these defects and poor Josephson junction performance has
      been observed.[7] Whether any of the defects which are
      visible in plan view with optical microscopy are identifiable
      with the defects seen in TEM cross-sections is not yet clear.
      The length scale of the the stacking faults and antiphase
      boundaries which are observed in cross-section is angstroms,
      while the size of optically observable surface defects is
      microns. Nonetheless, it may be that the nanoscale
      imperfections in film structure serve as nucleation points
      for the larger defects which are observed in plan view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the presence of planar defects and twins in the
      BiSrCaCuO films, the overall impression that TEM observations
      leave is one of a high degree of ordering. The
      low-magnification TEM image shown in Figure 7 illustrates
      this point. The bright layers in the image are three barrier
      layers, each designed to consist of a single molecular layer
      of 2278. Clearly these barriers are continuous over very
      large in-plane lengths, perhaps 1000 &Aring;. The in-plane
      continuity of the barriers is clearly larger than that
      out-of-plane, once again illustrating the inherent anisotropy
      of BiSrCaCuO growth. An estimate of the average film
      non-stoichiometry can be made from an enlarged version of the
      image in Figure 7 by comparing the observed total thickness
      of the film to the thickness of a perfect film with the same
      layering sequence. The comparison shows that the Bi:Cu ratio
      of the film deviates from the target composition by only
      about 1%. The thickness is determined by the Bi:Cu ratio
      since it is this ratio that determines which of the BiSrCaCuO
      compounds is formed.
