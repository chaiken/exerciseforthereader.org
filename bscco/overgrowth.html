    <p>
      Figure 1 shows a high-resolution image of 2212 overgrowth on
      a SrTiO<sub>3</sub> (001) substrate surface.
      SrTiO<sub>3</sub>1 has a lattice constant of 3.936 &Aring;,
      while that of 2212 in the c-axis direction is
      30.7&Aring;.[1,2] Examination of the image shows that the
      ratio of the interplanar spacing in the SrTiO<sub>3</sub> to
      that in the epilayer is in rough agreement with the ratio of
      the lattice constants. In addition, one can see good
      continuity between planes of atoms in the SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
      and in the overlayer, indicating a coherent interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most remarkable feature of the image shown in Figure 1 is
      the lack of conformity of the 2212 film to substrate surface
      features. In the center of the image, there is an asperity on
      the surface of the substrate. The bright lines in the 2212
      film are thought because of the image simulations (discussed
      further below) to be BiO planes. In the immediate vicinity of
      the defect, there is a slight amount of disorder in the BiO
      planes, but this disorder is healed on a very short lateral
      scale beyond which the BiO planes are straight and unbroken.
      In the vertical direction, the BiO planes are continuous at
      only two 2212 molecular layers above the substrate. Somehow
      the 2212 layer is able to accomodate the distortion caused by
      the substrate roughness within a single unit cell. The result
      is that after only two monolayers of 2212 growth, the surface
      of the film is significantly smoother than the substrate
      surface. Apparently the energetics of the 2212 growth are
      such that it is energetically costly to disrupt the bounding
      BiO planes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The healing of defects at the 2212/SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
      interface is in contrast to the propagation of roughness
      which is often observed in other epitaxial systems like
      Ge/Si[12] and GaAs/AlAs.[13] In some cases the distribution
      of defects on the surface of epitaxial films will be a
      replica of defects at the film-substrate interface. The shape
      of substrate-surface defects can even be propagated through
      the entirety of thick multilayer films.[13] Propagative
      roughness is minimized in multilayers meant for x-ray mirror
      applications by using an amorphous material as one of the
      constituents. For example, in Nb/Si and Mo/Si multilayers,
      TEM studies have shown that the crystalline transition metal
      layers have rough surfaces, but that the surfaces of the
      amorphous Si layer above them are considerably flatter.[14]
      Presumably healing occurs in the amorphous layer because the
      energetic cost of distorting local bonding to accomodate
      interface roughness is less than in the crystalline layers.
      The surprising aspect of the 2212 overgrowth on
      SrTiO<sub>3</sub> is that the roughness of the substrate is
      healed within a crystalline layer rather than an amorphous
      one. The image suggests that there is less of an energetic
      penalty associated with disrupting the stacking of the BiO
      and CuO layers than with bending them. This assertion is
      consistent with the ability to grow BSSCO-family materials
      with a varying number of CuO and Ca layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong tendency in the BiSrCaCuO materials to form
      continuous, straight BiO planes likely contributes to the
      success of the ALL-MBE technique with these materials. The
      naturally occurring layering in the BiSrCaCuO superconductors
      may be favorable for techniques which sequentially deposit
      the constituents, as ALL-MBE does. Efforts to grow the less
      anisotropic YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
      superconductors using a similar technique have been less
      successful.[15]
    </p>
    <p>
      The non-conformal growth of the 2212 may mean that coverage
      of lithographically patterned steps in possible
      superconducting microcircuits may be a problem. On the other
      hand, the insensitivity of the 2212 growth to the quality of
      the substrate surface undoubtedly means that substrate
      preparation techniques need be less stringent in this
      materials system than in many others. For example,
      high-quality overgrowth of Fe on Ag substrates requires
      painstaking surface preparation because the vertical mismatch
      of the Fe and Ag lattice constants causes disruption of the
      first three to four Fe monolayers at atomic steps on the
      substrate.[16] This disturbance occurs despite the good
      in-plane lattice match of Fe and Ag. The short range of the
      disruption of 2212 growth at asperities on the
      SrTiO<sub>3</sub> surface is further evidence of the
      inherently anisotropic nature of the 2212 compound.
