      The films used in this study were all grown using the ALL-MBE
      technique, which has been described in detail previously.[5]
      ALL-MBE is a variant of molecular beam epitaxy in which the
      composition and structure of a growing layered film are
      controlled by sequential evaporation of the constituent
      metals and their oxidation. The growth is performed in a
      highly reactive ozone atmosphere at elevated temperatures
      between 650 and 700&deg;C. Growth is monitored in situ by
      observing reflection high-energy electron diffraction
      patterns, and post-growth characterization has been performed
      by x-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering (RBS), Auger
      electron spectroscopy (AES), x-ray fluorescence (XRF),
      secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), and atomic force
      microscopy (AFM). The RHEED observations confirm that abrupt
      changes in crystalline phase can be made, namely that ALL-MBE
      allows alternate layers of 2212 and 2201 to be grown as a
      superlattice.[4] RBS, AES and EDAX measurements confirm that
      the stoichiometry of the films is within a few percent of the
      nominal value.[7] X-ray diffraction measurements show that
      single-phase growth is possible using the ALL-MBE
      technique.[8] Total film thickness is typically on the order
      of 1000 &Aring;. The superconducting transitions of all films
      used for TEM studies were measured resistively and found to
      be narrow, with a transition temperature T<sub>c</sub>
      similar to that reported earlier.[6] Films like those used
      for TEM sample preparation have been fabricated into tunnel
      junction devices.[5]
    </p>
    <p>
      Preparation of high-temperature superconducting films for
      examination by TEM has proven to be difficult. The major
      difficulties are as follows: differential thinning rates
      between substrate, film materials and materials used to
      fabricate the cross-section specimen; the inherent brittle
      nature of substrate and film materials; and the production of
      specimen-preparation-induced artifacts such as ion damage and
      amorphization. The results of these problems are specimens
      with only a small transparent region, fracture of the
      substrate and delamination of the film. To reduce and avoid
      the occurrence of these specimen preparation difficulties,
      advanced techniques are employed. The specimen preparation
      procedure described here employs a number of steps to avoid
      mechanical damage and reduce artifacts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic construction of the cross-sectioned specimen is
      similar to the techniques describe by Newcomb[9] and
      Bravman.[10] The following is a detailed description of how
      their procedure has been adapted for BiSrCaCuO films.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with, a piece of blank Si wafer is epoxied to the
      SrTiO<sub>3</sub> substrate of the superconducting thin film.
      The long direction of the Si strip is oriented on the surface
      of the film-substrate combination along the predetermined TEM
      viewing direction; i.e., [010] or [110]. The substrate is
      then trimmed away with a low speed diamond saw. The remaining
      Si/epoxy/film/substrate composite is laminated with epoxy
      between two semi-circular brass rods and inserted into a
      brass tube filled with epoxy. After curing, discs measuring
      .5 mm thick are sliced from the brass rod using a low-speed
      diamond saw. Disc specimens are lapped using a gravity feed
      holder from one side using a succession of fine diamond
      lapping films to a thickness of .25 mm. The specimen disc is
      then final polished on a vibrating polishing machine for
      several hours. Prior to lapping the second side, a Cu grid is
      epoxied to the polished surface for support. The second side
      is then lapped using the same diamond grit films to a final
      specimen thickness of 100 &micro;m (excluding the Cu grid).
      The specimen is dimpled from the second polished side
      directly on top of the Si/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> interface. The
      dimpling conditions are: 15 g load, 60 rpm, 2-4 &micro;m
      diamond powders. The final dimpled specimen thickness prior
      to ion milling is approximately 15-20 &micro;m. Dimpling to
      thinner dimensions often caused the substrate to fracture or
      the film to delaminate. Then a Gatan, Inc. PIPS ion mill is
      used to sputter the film at a low angle of 4.5&deg;.
      Low-angle ion milling in combination with ion beam modulation
      is utilized to reduce the difference in ion milling rates
      between the substrate, film, epoxy and Si. The first side of
      the specimen (dimpled side) is ion milled for about 90 min.
      The specimen is turned over and ion milled until perforation.
      After perforation both sides are again low-angle ion-milled
      at 1.5 keV to reduce surface damage. The specimen is examined
      using low-resolution electron microscopy, and if necessary is
      returned for further ion milling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to characterize the layering and defect
      microstructure of these atomically engineered films, high
      resolution electron microscopy (HREM) was utilized. A top
      entry JEOL 4000EX with a point-to-point resolution of 0.17 nm
      was used to image atomic structure detail in cross-sectioned
      specimens having film orientations of [010] and [110].
      Experimental images were recorded near the scherzer defocus
      value (approximately -45 nm) and the first cross-over of the
      contrast transfer function (approximately -75 nm). Images
      were also recorded at other defocus values at which specific
      layering and atomic structure detail was best resolved. The
      instrumental imaging conditions were as follows: 400 keV
      accelerating voltage, C<sub>s</sub> = 1.0 mm, focus spread of
      8.0 nm, beam semi-divergence angle of about 0.8 mr and an
      objective aperture radius of 0.096 nm<sup>-1</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The atomic structure of the layering was confirmed by
      comparison of the experimental images to those of simulated
      images. Calculation of the simulated images was performed
      using the MacTemPas software package.[11] Published lattice
      constants were used as inputs for 2201 and 2212, while
      lattice constants for 2278 and 1278 were estimated by using
      the same interatomic spacings as in the equilibrium phases.
      Since the specimen thickness and defocus conditions are
      unknown for particular images, calculations were performed
      for a range of values of these parameters.
