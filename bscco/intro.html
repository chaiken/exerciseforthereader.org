      Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>,
      called 2212, is the prototypical compound of a class of
      layered copper-oxide superconductors which have been studied
      extensively due to their high superconducting critical
      temperatures T<sub>c</sub>. Other known compounds in the
      BiSrCaCuO family, with the general formula
      Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>n-1</sub>Cu<sub>n</sub>O
      <sub>2n+4</sub>, include
      Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>6</sub>, called 2201, and
      Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O
      <sub>10</sub>, called 2223. Like other cuprate
      superconductors, 2212 is a highly anisotropic layered
      compound, with lattice parameters a = 3.818&Aring; and c =
      30.66&Aring;.[1,2] Despite the complexity of the large unit
      cell, layer-by-layer growth of films has been achieved, as
      has been demonstrated by the observation of oscillations in
      the intensity of reflection high-energy electron diffraction
      (RHEED) features during deposition.[3] Many cubic materials,
      notably GaAs, Si and various transition metals, can also be
      grown in a layer-by-layer fashion, so in itself the
      occurrence of RHEED oscillations is not remarkable. The
      unusual aspect of the 2212 oscillations is that each
      molecular unit is composed of 14 layers so that the cyclical
      growth pattern involves the formation of ordered layers
      within the unit cell as well as the accumulation of completed
      unit cells. Putting 2212 films in a multilayer along with
      other BiSrCaCuO compounds adds a further level of complexity.
      Because of the three different levels of ordering and the
      intrinsically strong anisotropy, the dynamics of growth in a
      multilayer made up of 2212 and its analogs can therefore be
      expected to be quite different from the case of semiconductor
      or metallic multilayers.

      Cross-sectional TEM is a useful tool for studying the
      microstructure of multilayers and for classifying stacking
      faults in layered structures. Here TEM images have been used
      to study the morphology of single films and heterostructures
      of BiSrCaCuO compounds which have been grown using ALL-MBE.
      This is a recently developed technique involving sequential
      deposition of materials from metal vapor sources (thermal
      effusion cells) in a highly reactive ozone atmosphere.[4] The
      ALL-MBE technique has made possible growth of high-quality
      multilayers and thereby fabrication of Josephson junctions
      with novel tunnel barriers.[4,5,6] Described below are TEM
      observations of a sampling of the heterostructures which can
      be grown by ALL-MBE, including 2212/2201 multilayers and
      heterostructures with 2278 barrier layers. In addition, the
      occurence of planar and line defects in 2212 and 2201 will be
      described and discussed in relation to the unusual growth
      modes of these materials. The TEM micrographs will be
      interpreted in comparison to image simulations produced by a
      sophisticated electron-ray-tracing software package.
