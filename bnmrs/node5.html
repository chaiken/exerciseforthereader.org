    <p>
      Because infrared spectroscopy on these BN films has indicated
      the presence of cBN, it is logical to ask whether the
      unexplained features in the films' spectra may result from a
      combination of hBN and cBN states. In fact, the occurrence of
      a step near 194 ev in the background intensity of the films'
      B K-edge spectra is probably an indication of the cBN phase.
      The peak at 199 eV in the BN/Si B K-edge data may also be due
      to a contribution from cBN. Also attributable to cBN is the
      increased intensity of the <em>sigma</em><sup>*</sup> peak
      with respect to the <em>pi</em><sup>*</sup> peak in the films
      N K-edge spectra. The size of the above-mentioned deviations
      from the hBN spectra appears to be correlated with the amount
      of cBN indicated in each film by the IR measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three fairly narrow peaks near 192.6, 193.2, and 194.0 eV
      in the films' B K-edge data (see <a href="table.html">Table
      1</a>) do not have analogs in the cBN or hBN data, nor are
      there similar features in the K-edge spectra of disordered C
      films.[<a href="references.html#denley80">4</a>] With much
      lower energy resolution, Fomichev and Rumsh previously
      reported a single broad peak near 194.0 eV in their study of
      hBN powder.[<a href="references.html#fomichev68">8</a>] The
      nearly constant energy spacing shows that these peaks are not
      a Rydberg series[<a href="references.html#stohrbook">1</a>]
      and the approximately 0.6 eV magnitude of the spacing rules
      out an origin involving lattice vibrations. The proximity of
      these sharp peaks to the <em>pi</em><sup>*</sup> excitonic
      peak suggests a related origin. One possibility is that
      stacking in the films is disordered and that the individual
      peaks represent different stacking configurations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that BN films are often non-stoichiometric,[<a href=
      "references.html#wada92">11</a>] another possibility is that
      these peaks represent a quasi-bound final state formed by a
      photoelectron and a N vacancy. The most obvious possibility
      is that these peaks are due to the presence of rBN, whose B
      K-edge spectrum shows similar small peaks, as documented in
      <a href="table.html">Table 1</a>. The unidentified peaks
      would then be due to modification of the <em>pi</em> bonding
      by the ABCA stacking that is characteristic of rBN. Positive
      identification rBN as a minor constituent of these films
      would require further study.
    </p>
    <p>
      A closer look at <a href="table.html">Table 1</a> and <a
      href="fig1.html">Figures 1a</a> and <a href=
      "fig2.html">2a</a> shows that the peaks for the film
      synthesized with the higher ion beam voltage and higher
      deposition rate are considerably broader than those for the
      other two films. Energetic ions have likely caused damage to
      this film, corroborating the findings of a previous IR and
      photoemission spectroscopy study by Wada and Yamashita on
      ion-assisted evaporation of BN films.[<a href=
      "references.html#wada92">11</a>] Wada and Yamashita also
      observed metallic B and a smaller amount of cBN in material
      grown at deposition rates above 1 &Aring; /s.[<a href=
      "references.html#wada92">11</a>] These results are consistent
      with the observation (see <a href="table.html">Table 1</a>)
      that the film synthesized at the higher deposition rate has a
      lower fraction of sp <sup>3</sup>-bonded material. Given the
      evident degree of disorder in this film, the recent
      observation of a preferred crystallographic orientation came
      as a surprise. NEXAFS and transmission electron microscopy
      experiments showed the hexagonal layer planes were oriented
      close to orthogonal to the substrate.[<a href=
      "references.html#BNapl">7</a>] This orientation is contrary
      to that usually observed in thin graphite films, where the
      c-axis is typically normal to the film-substrate
      interface.[<a href="references.html#denley80">4</a>]
